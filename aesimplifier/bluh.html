Instead, they staff had offered those insultingly small styrofoam cups full of either chocolate milk or cider for the kids. Though Almudena typically wasn't one for poor etiquette, she'd considered this affront justification for drastic measures. She'd nabbed half a dozen of the ciders, and was currently building a pyramid out of the empty cups on her desk.<br><br>Almudena glanced around the room. She'd been the first student to arrive, but then again, living in the dorms before they'd officially opened had helped with that. Some other students had been trickling into the room, but the only faculty apparent so far was the black lady in a suit and glasses standing by the stage.<br><br>The students had been instructed to meet in the auditorium instead of their classrooms for the first day of school, for what was ostensibly an orientation program. Almudena impatiently scuffed her shoe across the floor,  leaving a black streak on the varnished wood. As far as she could tell, this room was designed to function as both a gym and auditorium; though there was a stage out in front, there was basketball hoops at either end, and when she'd been grabbing her refreshments, she'd noticed the equipment room door behind the table.<br><br>A flurry of gleams played across the room, and drew Almudena's vision upwards. Beyond the stage, a huge window loomed, taking up almost the entire wall. Alma found herself questioning the practicality of such a feature in a school meant for Powers, but there was no denying that the view was stunning. The school had been situated on a hillside overlooking the ocean, giving an unrivaled vista of the shining waves. A massive freighter plowed onwards below, likely headed from Salcester to Brisance Bay. Despite being hundreds of feet long, from this far away, it looked like a mere toy. If Almudena craned her neck, she almost felt like she could even see across the vast expanse, to the shores of the Archipelago's biggest island.<br><br>Almudena took a messy bite of one of the donut holes the faculty had set out, the white powder getting all over her lips. She brought up her shirt sleeve, and wiped the sugar off on it. Though this school had no official uniform, she'd brought half a dozen over from her old school, and intended to make full use of them. Besides, she thought a white dress shirt and plaid skirt was a good look for her. While it might have made her blend in back home, here it'd let her stand out.<br><br>“Hey,” A quiet voice came from beside her. Almudena twisted at her desk, leaning with her elbow on the back of her seat. A boy with blonde, fluffy looking hair had taken the next seat over. From his skin, to his hair, to the blue of his eyes, everything about him was pale and delicate looking. Though she'd guess he was around her age and a bit taller than her, Almudena wouldn't be surprised if she outweighed him.<br><br>“Hola!” Almudena offered her free hand in greeting, not bothering to wipe the powdered sugar off of it. The new guy clasped it in a  limp handshake, his paper-white skin making Almudena's rich tan look even more intense. Almudena's doubts were confirmed; she probably could break every bone in his hand if she just tensed her muscles.<br><br>“So, are you new here?” The blonde asked, gingerly withdrawing his mitt from Almudena's grasp.<br><br>“Buddy, it's the first day of school here, <i>ever</i>. We're all new here.”<br><br>“Oh, yeah...” He blushed, grimacing. “Makes sense. What's your name?”<br><br>“Mi llamo es Almudena Madeiro,” She responded brightly, “But everybody calls me Alma. Y tu?”<br><br>“Garth Firbolg.”<br><br>“Furball?!” At her remark, Garth blushed even worse.<br><br>“No, Firbolg. It means 'Giant of Flame'.”<br><br>“Muy macho. Way too macho for you,” Almudena smirked, leaning further towards him, “I think I'm going to call you 'Blandengue'.”<br><br>Garth smiled whistfully.<br><br>“Honestly? It's not the worst thing I've been called...I think.”<br><br>Almudena shot a grin back.<br><br>“Don't worry, I'll come up with worse later.”<br><br>Garth patted the chest of his fleece pullover.<br><br>“You'd think they'd give us nametags.”<br><br>“Yeah, but I'm guessing they plan on having us all introduce ourselves to eahother soon enough. Thus why we have class with the kindergarteners today,” Almudena jerked her thumb towards the palatial window, “These people don't seem the type to cut corners.”<br><br>“I'm just wondering what sort of class we're going to end up with...” Garth shrugged, “The Powers I've met before have been a, ah, mixed bag, so to speak.”<br><br>“Well, I'm sorry to break your little heart,” Almudena turned back to face the front, “But it's all downhill from here, 'cause you just met the best one.”<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5111768').toggle();if($('#spoiler5111768').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5111768">OOC: I'd say I'm going to give people until next Sunday or so to write some general chatting around and characters showing up for class, and then I'll see about launching into the actual plot proper.</div></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Jay, come on!"<br> <br>Carlos was half-way through pulling his jacket on, skin still damp from the ocean water, when he saw his friend still idling against the rock. Jay was all muscle, strong arms and broad shoulders and long dark hair falling back against the stone, which was all good and well but if Carlos' watch was still accurate (and he had made sure it was specifically to avoid something like this happening, but stuff happens, no big deal), if they didn't get moving <i>right the fuck now</i> they'd be late for the orientation session. By the time he'd pulled on his shoes and zipped his jacket up, Jay had finally pulled himself away from the rock he'd been idling on and grabbed the vest resting on the ground nearby.<br> <br>"Hey, it's all good," Jay's lazy reply came.<br> <br>The pair had snuck out just before dawn with the intention of having an hour or two on the beach before heading back up for the orientation. The beach, or the rocky area they had found that was mostly secluded and covered in shingle as opposed to sand, was Carlos' favourite area on (or at least near) campus. Back in New York, he had never been allowed anywhere near the water on the few times he had been able to escape his house. It was always there, just past the buildings and on the horizon with the bridges connecting to Manhattan, the surface glittering like diamonds under the sun. They'd found this spot within the first week of moving to the school, just a bit further away from the sandy beach and surrounded by enough rocks that they could easily hide among them in case anyone came looking for them. It wasn't the picturesque image that he'd had back home, the water a darker shade of blue and the surface not glittering in quite the right way, but it was close enough that he could actually step into the cool water for the first time in his life. Tiny fish swam around their feet in the shallows and Carlos would laugh whenever he moved suddenly and they scattered.<br> <br>The trek back to the school wasn't particularly long but it was all uphill and uneven with half-buried rocks and errant tree roots threatening to trip them every other step and <i>oh shit is that a squirrel, not going that way</i>. Jay was strong but Carlos was faster and more nimble on his feet, easily bounding over grass and rock and tree stump as he ran his fingers through his hair to try to shake some of the salt water from it as Jay pushed through the bushes that seperated the campus from the surrounding land. Sneaking in and out of the campus had proven surprisingly easy for the pair of them, both of them used to having to hide in shadows when moving around. Their non-verbal communication, a series of expressions and hand signals, had let them evade any security so far and Carlos was secretly immensely grateful he'd been roomed with Jay. They got each other in that way and, aside from the occasional ribbing, they got along quite well. The lither teenager caught a glimpse of his reflection in a mirror as they crept around to a side entrance of the building and immediately started running his hands through his dyed hair to try to get the volume back into it.<br> <br>As it turned out, as soon as they entered the school there was no need to be sneaky. The various students were all still in different stages of attendance - there was more than one yawning face and a lot of eye-rubbing going on - letting them blend into the crowd easily, even with Carlos' bright red and white jacket and Jay's sheer bulk. The auditorium-stroke-gym had been arranged with desks covering the majority of the floor but the retractable bleachers that lined one wall had been extended out as well and that was where Carlos saw the lilac hair of Mel. Top right corner sat next to Evelyn, who's raven hair was falling in neat curls around her shoulders. Ignoring the snacks on the table, he nudged Jay in the side and pointed. Jay gave him a light shove <i>and that hurt, asshole</i> then started running towards the bleachers as Carlos regained his balance, Carlos on his heels as soon as he'd gotten his feet back under him.<br> <br>"Make it topple with such ease, summon up a sturdy breeze," Mel muttered under her breath as they approached, flicking her hand towards the small tower one of the other students had been building out of the polystyrene cups. A gust of wind, not strong enough to be an actual force of nature but too strong to be from the air conditioning units, whirled around the pyramid of cups balanced in front of what looked like an average girl in a uniform <i>but I'm pretty sure there isn't a uniform policy here? Whatever.</i> The wind picked the cups up and threw them over both the girl and the weak-looking kid next to her. Mel gave a satisfied smirk, Carlos and Jay high-fived and Evelyn giggled before pulling out a pocket mirror and touching up her lipstick.<br> <br>Carlos rested his feet on the seat in front of him and watched the other students entering auditorium. There was a gap in the crowd as the doors swung close for a moment before opening again, and another student entered on his own. Tall, messy brown hair, blue and gold clothes that were just tight enough to hint at a strong physique but loose enough not to give too much away. Carlos watched him enter the hall and walk over to the snack table.<br> <br>"Who's the pretty boy?" Jay asked, an edge of <i>something</i> in his voice but Carlos couldn't figure out what. Or couldn't be bothered to figure out what. Whatever.<br> <br>"I don't know, but he's <i>dreamy</i>," Evelyn replied with a sigh. The sort of sigh he'd heard Evelyn do a couple of times now, actually. It was her 'there's a pretty face so I'm happy' sigh. Mel scoffed.<br> <br>"Dreamy isn't good enough for you, Eve," she said as though she'd had this conversation a million times before. She probably had.<br> <br>Carlos watched the boy for a few moments longer before Jay grabbed him in a headlock <i>and son of a bitch, Jay, are you sure you don't have your super strength on</i>.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">AngelicTragedy</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Yes, okaasan, I'm sure that things will go well today." Titus breathed into his cell phone, forcing himself to keep his irritation in check.<br><br>Titus, or Ty as he preferred to be called, had had this conversation six times over the past week.  He loved his mother and all her overprotective ways but at times he wished that she would lay off.  Ty figured that it was all a part of his mothers Japanese upbringing in Tokyo.  Ty's grandfather was a strict man and his grandmother was the very definition of a perfectionist, luckily these traits were deluded in his mother.<br><br>"Okaasan, I really need to get to class.  I'll call you this weekend, okay?" Ty hung up his phone quickly without waiting for a response.<br><br>Ty grabbed his messenger bag and slid out of his dorm room.  He was extremely glad that his parents had sprung for a private room in the dorms to keep distractions to a minimum, though the recent changes to his body had made being around others his own age uncomfortable.  Ty had always been aware that the fact that he was the child of a white collar American man and a driven Japanese woman made him different, especially in his home town in Arkansas, but that was now the least of his worries.  Though he was barely over fourteen years old he appeared to be in his early twenties.  Tall and thin, Ty moved like a boy in a man's body.  On his thirteenth birthday Ty had a mishap with his power and was stricken with an unnatural growth spurt.  <br><br>Ty ambled down the stairs and through a side door from the dorms into an adjoining garden.  Roses, lavender, jasmine, and orchids packed the lattice arches over the path and perfumed the air in an intoxicating bouquet.  Ty loved this garden more than any place he'd been to thus far on campus.  He'd spent hours among the flowers reading, studying, or just napping.  The air smelt of his mothers perfume and gave him a sense of belonging that was hard to come by.  Ty stopped for a moment to fill his lungs with the scent of the air around him, popped a yellow rose from a bush, and placed the stem of it into the small pocket on the left side of his vest before continuing on towards the auditorium.  <br><br>After a brief walk Ty entered the gym/auditorium and quickly grabbed a cup of cider.  Placing his back up against the wall for a moment to get his bearings on the assembled students, Ty began swirling his drink slowly and focused.  After a few seconds steam began to rise from the styrofoam cup sending the rich scent of cinnamon and apple airborne.  Ty took note of his surroundings; the huge window overlooking the sea, a growing group of students in the bleachers, a boy and girl getting pelted with empty cups by no evident force.  There was so much to take in and so many people to study that Ty felt a bit dizzy just thinking about what the next few hours would hold.  Ty sipped his now steaming cider, straightened his charcoal grey vest and black shirt, and took a seat within earshot of the uniformed girl and sickly looking boy.<br><br>"<i>Well, here goes nothing.</i>"</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">As her monument to finished beverages exploded, Almudena wheeled in her seat. The feet of her desk screeched loudly. She snatched a napkin out of the air without even looking towards it, and slapped it down on the desktop with a bang.<br><br>"It wasn't me!" A little girl in pigtails and glasses yelped from behind her, reflexively ducking under her desk.<br><br>"No sweat, niña," Almudena braced herself on the crossbar of her seat, vaulting to her feet. She glimpsed around the room, until she spotted the crew on the bleachers. She scooped up a donut hole from where it had fallen on the floor, and then lobbed it gently into the air, checking its weight as she caught it.<br><br>"You-" Garth spluttered as a cup caught him in the face, "You're not going to-" The cup did another loop, smacking him in the forehead. He grabbed it, crushing it in his hand.<br><br>"Not going to retaliate-" Another cup ricocheted off the back of his skull. Garth sighed, and put his head down. The cup twirled in place, as if trying to seek its target.<br><br>"Personally, Furball, I don't believe in revenge," Almudena rolled her shoulder, cracking the joint loudly, "The ladies at my old school taught me better than that. If you're out to hurt people just because they slighted you, you're just going to make everything even worse."<br><br>She turned away from the clique on the bleachers, with a sigh.<br><br>"Of course, on the other hand, I do believe in punishment."<br><br>Almudena chucked the donut into the air, and pivoted on her heel. Her right fist shot forwards, leveraging the full force of her body into a gigantic punch. In mid-swing, a transparent hammer of force appeared, moving with the blow. The strike plowed into the pastry as it fell, the powdered sugar blasting out into a swirling plume. It rocketed across the room like a confectionary comet, spewing crumbs as it streaked away. It smashed into the wall above the bleachers with a loud thump, instantly disintegrating into a white and yellow cloud. The sticky debris wafted down in a fine mist.<br><br>The pugilist dusted her hands off, and sat back down.<br><br>"It wasn't me!" Pigtails yelped again, still peering from under her desk.<br><br>"Um, hello," Garth stammered. Keeping his head low to evade the swooping cup out for his blood, he glanced over to Ty's seat, "No worries. As you can see, you really haven't missed much."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">As Talia wandered into the auditorium the aroma of coffee wafted against her face and she took a deep breath, savoring it.  The aroma reminded her of every morning for the past two years when she awoke to the house smelling of coffee and she knew that her mother and grandmother were downstairs cooking breakfast.  It was one of very few good memories in her life and she clung to it for comfort and to keep the memories of her broken childhood at bay.<br><br>She was a lithe, curvy young woman with dirty-blonde locks that hung just past her shoulders and pale, blue eyes.  She wore a loose plaid shirt that buttoned down the front and sported a pattern of bright, orange squares interlaced by a trio of white lines and smaller, thin, blue lines as well as a pair of tight, ankle-length blue jeans and simple brown sandals.  She had always prefered sandals to shoes, mainly because she found that shoes often blocked her ability to detect and tap into vibrations in the ground.  Because of her particular powers it often felt to her as if she possessed two extra senses compared to most other people and anything that blocked or dampened those senses made her feel distressed similar to how normal people would feel if they lost their ability to see or hear.<br><br>As she began to look around at the other students, Talia shoved the thick, hardcover book that had been in her hand under her right arm and then shoved her hands into her pockets.  She could sense every vibration in the large room coming from every molecule in every physical object, even the other students.  This was overlayed by every sonic projection beyond normal human hearing, though she wasn’t actually hearing these sounds, it was more like sensing their presence and understanding them, but not through her ears.  She had never been very good at describing her extra senses, but the line between physical vibrations and sonic waves was so fine for her it may as well have not even existed at all.<br><br>Talia observed many of the students, letting her senses wash over them as she scanned the room, bypassing the snack table filled with cheap offerings masked by the false advertising of the aroma of coffee.  The first student she noticed was a very tall man who looked to be in his twenties, half-asian, yet his mannerisms suggested than he was much younger than he looked.  His molecular vibrations suggested that there was something off about him, as though his body had been somehow...altered.  Next she observed a group of three students within earshot of the first boy.  One was of a darker complexion, she guessed of some hispanic descent, a pale, sickly looking boy and a young girl in pigtails.  She could not tell anything particularly off about them and so moved on to other students.  When she scanned over the group of two boys and two girls at the far, top corner of the bleachers she noticed something odd.  One of the two girls seemed to have molecular brain vibrations typical of non-powers, but she was here so she must have some unique ability.  She guessed it must be some sort of power that did not result from genetics or otherwise cause physical or genetic alterations, like magic.<br><br>Once she had concluded her scan of the auditorium and the students within, Talia took an isolated seat near the back and proceeded to crack open the book she had been carrying.  The cover read something about The Science of Vibrations.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Girl's got teeth," Carlos commented with appreciation as he watched the dusty remnants of the thrown doughnut threaten to swirl down on them. He'd caught a glimpse of something as she'd punched the confectionery, but chalked it up to <i>powers are weird</i>.<br><br>"Keep the donut crumbs at bay, wind sweep the debris away," Mel said as she swept her arm above her head. A second gust of wind caught the dust and swirled through the air, effectively shielding the four of them from getting even remotely sticky. Carlos gave his jacket a once-over to make sure there was no jelly or sugar marking the red leather because like hell could he afford dry-cleaning on that baby. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Evelyn doing the same - her make-up was still on point and there was no sign of any 'war wounds' (as she would put it) from the doughnut.<br><br>It was definitely possible that she'd only ever called smudged make-up that once and he was just latching on to it.<br><br>He settled back in his seat and kept his eyes on the doors as they continued to swing open and close, more students piling in. Everyone looked exceptionally... ordinary. He wasn't entirely sure why he expected otherwise, it wasn't as though every power was some half-human hybrid like that weird race of rat people <i>and if they're human sized rats does that mean they have bigger teeth? Gross</i>. What he guessed was a staff member walked in, grey suit and black shirt and walking with a complete lack of grace. He caught Evelyn's eye and quickly catalogued the skeptical expression.<br><br>"He looks five minutes older than us," Jay chipped in, frowning at the guy in the suit. "He a TA or just dumb?"<br><br>Jay had a point, the dude was clearly too old to be a student unless he'd been held back more than once. Like, a lot more than once. He looked a bit shifty now that Carlos looked a bit closer, taking a cup of cider and sitting close-but-not-too-close to the girl with the impressive punch. The cup was steaming now, somehow warming up just by being in the guy's hand. That was a neat trick. Probably saved him on an electric bill, not having to use a microwave to heat stuff up. Was that a common power, were they hiring themselves out..? Carlos hated it when he went to take a drink of coffee and experienced that terrible moment when he realised he'd left it for too long and it had gone cold.<br><br>"Don't be brazen, don't be bold, make that cider drink go cold," Mel said, eyes narrowing in on the cup. The steam instantly dissipated and Carlos smirked. Mel had a real sense of humour with stuff like that, one he really liked. It wasn't punishing people, not really, no matter how much she tried to make it out to be. It was just... messing with people. "No reason for him to have a warm drink when no one else gets one."<br><br>Jay laughed again and pounded Carlos' back <i>seriously Jay, again? Dial down the super strength, I don't need bruises</i>. <br><br>"So what kinds of powers do you think everyone has?" Evelyn asked. She was looking in her pocket mirror again so Carlos couldn't decide if she was filling a gap in conversation or if she was actually wondering.<br><br>"Flight and fire control," he deadpanned, eliciting a reluctant giggle from Mel. He shot her a grin before looking back at the other students in the room. No one was particularly standing out to him as being particularly special or powerful or whatever. <br><br>"I think that girl down there has the same power as you, Carlos," Jay commented, nodding to a girl who was sat with a pretty hefty book in her hands. "Supernaturally nerdy."<br><br>"Or supernaturally unable to co-ordinate an outfit, like you," Carlos shot back. "Orange and blue in the same outfit, really. Cutting edge fashion right there."<br><br>Evelyn snapped her mirror shut at that comment and her eyes immediately went to the girl in question. They were visually a pretty unlikely pair, Evelyn and Carlos, with Evelyn's dark blue tones to her clothes, all flowing skirts and shirts that accentuated her... <i>uh, her assets</i>, while he was loud and vibrant with bleached hair <i>might keep the roots this time actually, looks pretty good</i> and red and white leather jacket, black shorts and high-top sneakers. Their common ground was fashion - Evelyn had lived and breathed fashion when she was growing up and Carlos figured he had a pretty good eye for it, if Evelyn's consistent approval of his outfits was any indication. Already he could see the cogs whirring in her head, figuring out how to salvage what the girl was wearing.<br><br>"You're right, the orange is the problem here," she decided, pursing her lips as she stopped to think. "And the sandals, no one wears sandals any more, this isn't the nineties."<br><br>Carlos smirked again and leaned back in his seat in a move that was definitely not a way to limit how much Jay could hit him on the back. No sir.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Sitting on the roof of the dorm, Flint looked toward the sea.  He crossed his legs into a meditating position and slowly closed his vibrant ice blue eyes.  A slight breeze carried the sweet scent of cherry blossoms into his nose as it slowly caressed his white hair causing it to dance playfully.  The salty sea air mixed with the other scents to create a very comforting smell.  It reminded him of home, except in Greenland there were no cherry trees.  Opening his eyes slowly, Flint saw two boys about his age sneaking back onto the school grounds.  The security on campus would never catch them, but he guessed they were not too concerned with other students seeing them.  They seemed to be foreigners like him, most of the people here were. As they entered the gymnasium Flint remembered the announcement earlier that everyone was to meet there today.  Glancing down at his watch he realized that if he didn’t hurry he would be late.  His sleeves had fallen slightly down his arms as he stood so Flint pushed them back to their previous position below his elbows.  This black cashmere sweater was much lighter than the clothes from his village.  In fact all of his clothes where lighter. His sweater hugged his form but wasn’t really tight.  The blue jeans he wore fit him much like the sweater but seemed to be made of a more flexible fabric for ease of movement.  On his right wrist was a leather anchor bracelet and on the left was his Timex watch, its cloth band was a solid dark blue with a single grey stripe running through the middle.  Reaching down Flint brushed a flower petal from his white vans.  The blue feather that was printed on the outside of each shoe made them distinctive from other pairs he had seen before.  Grabbing his bag he jumped down from the roof and landed lightly on his feet. The bag looked like a large black and white rag doll; one of its eyes was an x while the other was a circle.  <br><br>Running toward the gym, Flint began to slow down when he saw a guard at the door.  Speeding back up, Flint ran past the guard and flashed him a smile.  The guard paid little attention and continued with his duty.  Apparently it wasn’t unusual for students to still be coming in.  As soon as he entered the gym Flint ducked, narrowly avoiding a stay cup that had cascaded across the room.  The smell of spiced cider and coffee began to assault his nostrils.  The students inside seemed to already be separating into cliques.  There was a group of them over by the bleachers, but they seemed busy amongst themselves.  The other group was seated at the desks and were very loud.  The loudest one seemed to be a girl with a dark tan; probably Hispanic.  There were a few students that had not gone with either clique and had positioned themselves randomly around the room.  <br><br>Sidestepping a flying donut Flint made his way to a desk near the loud Hispanic girl.  It would be harder to read with her nearby but at least there wouldn’t be any appetizer projectiles flying in his direction.  Removing his bag, Flint sat down next to a young girl with pigtails who was hiding under her desk.  Extracting a large history book from the ragdoll, he opened it and began marking large sections with a sharpie marker, blotting out the writing. Glancing over Flint saw that the young girl was still cowering under her desk.  Reaching into his bag he pulled out two pieces of saltwater toffee.  Choosing the pink toffee with purple dots, Flint removed the wrapper and popped it into his mouth.  Grabbing the other toffee, an interesting mixture of blue and green, he tossed it on top of the little girl’s desk before returning to marking his book.<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">AngelicTragedy</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Ty moved to take another sip of his cider and felt the cup go suddenly cold in his grasp.  Someone had already started playing pranks and class hadn't even began.  Ty took a deep breath, cast his attention around the room, and heard a laugh ring out from the bleachers behind him.  He turned slightly and noted a boy in blue and orange booming out in general good humor among a small grouping of students.  Ty knew that someone in this group had been the prankster but which one was much harder to tell.  It didn't really matter to Ty, he'd play their game.<br><br>"Punishment isn't really what they need, it's a taste of their own medicine."<br><br>Ty poured a bit of the ice cold cider into the palm of his right hand and cocked his hand like he was about to throw a frisbee.  In a smooth motion that belied his awkward nature, Ty slung his hand forward creating a shower of droplets that arced around him.  His focus tightened and he picked the movement of four of the largest drops in front of him to be his ammo.  By force of will Ty warped the vectors of the droplets movement to shove them on a course towards the group in the bleachers.  After a brief moment of movement at normal speed the drops became streaks of apple scented liquid moving abnormally fast.  Ty guided the refreshing spears along four lines in his minds eye, forcing the liquid towards the centers of each of the groups foreheads at an insane rate of speed.  Normally, at their rate of speed the cider would have pierced skin but Ty reined in the force of the streams so that they would just splatter harmlessly against his targets faces.<br><br>"That's how you do it." Ty commented to himself, but also directing the comment back towards the nearest students.<br><br>Ty sat back into his chair and pulled a napkin from his bag.  He sat about wiping off his hand and the floor around him, drying the ark of cider that he had created a moment before.  Ty was used to pranks and ribbing from fellow students, he hand dealt with it all his life.  It wasn't anything new for him to see as you tend to get use to it when you're pushed up several grades.  You're the small kid, the little genius, and that seemed to get under peoples skin.  You were an easy target that could be harassed at will and if you were caught it could be played off as a harmless prank that you didn't understand because you were so young.  It was the first step towards bullying, and Ty hated bullies.  He'd dealt with them all his life too.  When you're the little kid in class that aces every test you are bound to experience bullying at some point.  Though, in Ty's case, it hadn't stopped after his accident.  When you leave school one day at 4'10" and come into class the next day at 6' you are opened up to a whole new world of trouble.  Ty turned towards the nearest tables, dropped the napkin back into his bag, and smiled a lopsided grin.<br><br>"I'm Ty by the way."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Silumas</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><i>Wretched children.<br></i><br><br><br>The tenor snap of a well-heeled boot striking the floor was heard far in advance of Silumas entering the auditorium, gymnasium, chaotic ball of annoyances. <br><br><b>*clack*<br><br></b><br>The secondary education teacher for the new school was easily identifiable. He was neither tall nor short, skinny nor fat. His perfectly tailored suit wrapped around him in just such a manner to accentuate his athletic form, but still be tastefully modest. His short, black hair was immaculately groomed, long on top with buzzed sides.<br><br><br><b>*clack*<br><br></b><br>His face was sharp and angular, cheek bones heavily accentuating his piercing, hazel eyes. They fluctuated between bright, emerald green and a deep brown, though it could all be attributed to the angle of the viewer and the light of the room. Bushy, black eyebrows were well groomed, though appeared they might go wild at a moment's notice. A goatee framed his mouth, connecting to a consummate moustache, thin and gleaming, like his hair. <br><br><b><br>*Clack*<br><br></b><br>His suit was composed of pitch black slacks, identically colored blazer, blood red shirt, and matching tie, in a full Windsor knot. His shoes were a black cowboy boot, with red trimming. His left coat pocket contained a small, flawlessly folded pocket square, blood red with an intricate black pattern woven into it. While it was impossible to make out a designer by simply looking (those with the fashion-sense likely couldn't place it with any known artist), the suit appeared to be something any self-respecting '.1%er' would find themselves in.<br><br><b><br>*CLACK*<br><br></b><br>Silumas' shoe's rang out as he reached the front of the auditorium where the rest of the staff would be gathering. He turned swiftly, but not supernaturally so, and sat into one of several chairs placed there. He was situated off the to the left side, not centralized at all. Strangely, after sitting, the chair seemed to grow more grandiose and throne-like than it had appeared a moment before, but it was hard to tell if that was the chair growing or simply the man filling it royally. Crossing his right leg onto his left knee, he placed both elbows on the arm of the chair, his fingers forming a steeple before his face. <br><br><br>His expression was neutral, eyes slowly, steadily, and all-together aloofly scanning the students that had arrived before him. He noticed the clique on the bleachers casually testing the rest of the class, then the one slinging cider at the previous group, followed by the young lady building architecture out of drinking glasses, then the young man speaking to her, then the young man helping the little girl hiding under the table, followed by the young lady reading about Vibrations. It was likely hard to notice, but his lips stretched in the barest hint of a smile. That smile was nothing appealing though. His eyes flashed with it, and for the barest moment it seemed they had turned red with a baleful fire within them. Everything frightening and evil was held in those eyes for the briefest of seconds before his expression returned to a calm, uncaring neutral.<br><br><br><br><i>Wretched children. So full of promise, overfilled with potential. They will not be allowed to waste it.<br></i><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia was aware of every single word that came out of the mouths of the clique on the bleachers, but there insults about her attire did little to irritate her.  She had devoted much effort to keeping her anger in check eversense the violent end to her broken childhood over two years ago.  Despite this she smirked with amusement at the cider attack launched upon them by the half-asian boy with the altered body.  Despite her senses she was unable to determine whether his power involved telekinesis or some sort of manipulation of kinetic forces.<br><br>While she was not angered by the insults about her attire, she was amused enough by the cider attack that she decided to join in teaching them a lesson.  Talia focused on the ambient sound echoing around the auditorium, not just what she could hear, but also that beyond normal human hearing.  As her mind plucked various sound waves from the air she redirected them at the clique on the bleachers and then manipulated those waves and twisted them into a deep, growling voice that sounded as if could be a disembodied demon.<br><br>“Do you honestly think I can’t hear every single word that comes out of your mouth?”  The voice suddenly growled in Evelyn and Carlos’s ears from the left, followed by inaudible whispers before the voice suddenly growled in their ears from the right.<br><br>“How many people with unknown powers do you plan on making enemies of today?  Tsk tsk tsk, not very wise.”<br><br>As the voice cackled demonically around them, Talia manipulated the molecular vibrations of the air around the four of them, forcing the molecules to vibrate with such a force that they heated rapidly, making the air uncomfortably hot.<br><br>“Try not to sweat your mask of makeup off, or ruin your clothes”, the voice growled at them again, followed by another demonic cackle that slowly faded away.<br><br>Talia’s face remained squarely in her book the entire time that she was screwing with them, hiding her amused grin.  She knew there was little chance they knew what she was capable of, but she didn’t much care if they knew it was her.  Still, she doubted they did.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Jay was on his feet as soon as the TA-or-dumb guy started pouring his drink on his hand. Carlos noted, with only a tiny bit of disappointment, that his power couldn't be re-heating drinks if he was pouring it away instead of just zapping it warm again. The droplets of fluid floating in the air for a second and Carlos was just a bit mesmerized by the way they hung there <i>dude that's an awesome party trick</i> until four droplets suddenly shot towards them. Jay turned and spread his arms wide, the cider hitting his back and arms instead of (judging by where they splattered on Jay) the group's faces. Evelyn produced a make-up wipe from her small clutch she carried everywhere and passed it to him.<br><br>"Dude took it personally," Carlos started with a small frown as Jay wiped the backs of his arms where the cider had hit. He opened his mouth to continue, but a sudden deep and growling voice sounded next to him. It didn't take a genius to figure out it wasn't his friends messing with him. Mel and Jay were looking at both him and Evelyn with matching confused expressions, they couldn't hear the voice Carlos figured, but Evelyn just pursed her lips, looking completely unimpressed <i>and it is pretty unimpressive, I mean that man-child-guy just tried to decapitate us with cider</i>. He felt the air suddenly heat up but it didn't exactly compare to a New York summer.<br><br>"I came from Florida, my make-up has survived hurricanes and tropical storms," Evelyn said bluntly, tossing her hair over her shoulders. She'd probably already figured out who the voice was coming from. Carlos' eyes flickered to the fashion-challenged girl with her face in a book. There was a threat to Evelyn's make-up, it was almost definitely some retaliation for the judgement on the girl's outfit. <i>Must be something to do with sound waves or something, girl's all smoke and mirrors.</i>. Evelyn, he noticed, didn't even bother to check her make-up. Jay and Mel were still wearing their confused faces but he just shrugged.<br><br>Carlos didn't look back at the girl as he said, "Girl can't take criticism. I mean as far as threats go, my mother set the bar pretty high, this doesn't even make me flinch." If she'd heard their commentary on her outfit <i>and isn't that a creepy power, supernatural eavesdropping</i> she'd probably heard that too. He wasn't lying either, nights of sleeping on dirty coats and covering his tan skin in foundation to try to cover bruises and glasses smashing on the wall behind him, the shards slicing his skin as they bounced off him flashing through his head before he firmly shut them away. <br><br>"These guys need to learn how to take a joke," Mel commented, sitting up a bit straighter in her seat and Carlos couldn't help but agree <i>I mean super punch girl was the most violent but that was all doughnut, she didn't turn it on us like these two</i>. There was a murmur of agreement from Evelyn and Jay. Carlos cast his eyes around the room again, finally resting as he noticed someone looking at them. It was the guy in blue and gold, looking right at Carlos was an amused expression on his face, just a small quirk in his lips as though he'd found the entire exchange funny but not enough to join in. <i>Huh. There's that.</i> Carlos winked at him and shot a cheeky grin before turning his attention to the man who's footsteps were loud to the point of being obnoxious.<br><br>A sharply dressed man, clearly faculty and looked like a hard-ass <i>looks like a caricature of a Disney villain</i> in black and red and boots that stood out in all the wrong ways. He even had the villainous goatee and whatever work he'd done to his eyebrows just wasn't quite right <i>if you have facial hair shouldn't that be the defining feature on your face, not can't-be-tamed bushes above your eyes?</i> But despite that, he had a presence, something about the way he walked and held himself, his posture and expression, it demanded attention and he was practically sweating authority. Between entering the room and taking a seat at the front of the auditorium, he never said a word but every single eye was on him.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Looking up from his vandalized book, Flint glanced at the source of the clacking sound that echoed through the room.  An imposing figure had walked onto the stage.  The suit he wore seemed to exemplify his aura of power.  Despite such an intimidating appearance Flint nearly let out a small laugh. The man on the stage, presumably one of the instructors or principal, had some of the bushiest eyebrows he had ever seen.  Choking down the giggle Flint reached into his bag and pulled out another book.  It was much smaller than the history book he had previously been engrossed in. Its pages were thin and bound in black leather. There was no apparent title on the cover, simply a small rune imprinted in the bottom corner.  Flipping through the pages Flint examined the instructors face carefully.<br><br>“He isn’t on the list.” Flint mumbled to himself before shoving the small book back into his bag.  Looking up, his eyes fell on the bleacher clique. “Maybe I should add one of them to the list.” The thought drifted around his mind for a few seconds.  Flint slowly shook his head from side to side. “I don’t think it’s worth it.” He thought to himself. <br><br>Reaching back into his bag Flint found another piece of toffee and threw it into his mouth.  Looking back at his book he returned to blacking out large blocks of text.  He didn’t want to get involved in this exchange of powers between the two cliques. After all he didn’t have any particular connection to either group and no one had messed with him yet.   <br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><i>Doesn't even make you flinch huh?</i>  Talia thought as the clique on the bleachers whined about being messed with the way they were messing with people.  If only they had any idea how lethal her powers really were and the fact that at a young age she had already had blood on her hands, so to speak.  Talia shut her eyes tightly and just focused on the endless vibrations all around her, trying to find any distraction to stop her mind from delving into the memories of the night she had accidently become a murderer.<br><br>She sensed the loud clacking of shoes coming from the front of the auditorium, likely long before anyone else noticed it.  However, she soon lost interest in the clacking sound as her senses washed over the front of the auditorium and discovered the source, just before he walked in and took a seat.<br><br>Talia opened her eyes and peered over the top of her book to see a sharply dressed man in red and black with his hands in a steeple before his face and a sneer across his lips.  Had it not been for her other senses she’d likely have written him off as some douche bag, one-percenter trying to portray himself as a villain out of some comic book.  However, his molecular vibrations were extremely bizarre, even the vibrations of the air around him seemed odd.  She did not exactly know what this meant, but regardless he was a man and an authority figure and so he was not to be trusted.  She had few ill feelings about boys her own age or younger, but older men in general were never to be trusted, a belief that she had her abusive father and the police where she once lived in the US to thank for.  Plus, the way this man looked over the students in the auditorium also made her suspicious of his actual purpose for being there.<br><br>She quickly cataloged him in her mind as someone to avoid whenever possible and she was now a bit anxious to see what the rest of the faculty were like.  All she could do now was pray that the entire faculty was not male, that she could simply not deal with.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">He'd been here before. No, he hadn't. Well, somewhere like here. Yeah, obviously, this was what a basketball court looked like. No, but like this place <i>specifically</i>. The ceiling hadn't been arched, and there had been lightbulbs all along the front of the stage, and the rings of the court had been painted in blue instead of red, but the walls had been just the same, exposed brick long and white plaster short, and the scoreboards had hung in the same two corners, and if he tuned inward he could hear the kids at play, an echoing rhythm of shout and footfall and rubber against polished wood...<br><br>No. He'd never.

He drew a star in a free corner.<br><br>Then he turned the page back. He hadn't written anything about the others yet. The tall, uncomfortable-looking boy down there whose legs barely seemed to fit at his chair, the weedy blond boy who'd somehow gotten the Catholic schoolgirl's attention, the tiny girl behind them who only occasionally popped her head up from beneath her desk, and the white-haired boy with cold features who sat next to her, unwrapping a piece of candy; the cool crowd, a quartet sitting across from him on the bleachers opposite, including a fellow black boy who was as strapping as Deandre was slim (though Deandre's endlessly bunching navy hoodie gave the appearance of bulk); the girl in one of the farthest seats from the stage, her face - like Deandre's own - buried in a book, though she was reading instead of writing. Or was she? She hadn't looked up or turned the page for a good minute.<br><br>He wanted to capture them all; keep every face in his notes, having no idea who he might make friends with and who never better than to know their name; who, ten years from now, he might want to remember seeing for the first time, and who he'd forget.

Now that Flint was closer, he could tell that she was Asian, though he couldn't discern exactly where she was from. She crept out from under the desktop, and cautiously plucked the candy from where he'd left it.<br><br>“...Thank you,” She said clearly but quietly. Slowly rising and twisting so as to be properly seated again, she began unwrapping the treat.<br>“My name's Dalisay. Dalisay Salazar,” She offered in greeting, glancing over to see if the older boy was actually paying attention to her, “But everybody calls me-”<br><br>“Dallas!” Almudena barked out jovially.<br><br>“But that's not- “<br><br>“Oh, come on, nina! Dallas is great! It's got vaqueros and soap operas and Wishbone and it used to be part of Mexico, so it's pretty much the best place ever,” Alma glanced over her shoulder, her eyes brilliant. She turned back to face the front, lacing her fingers behind her head, “I've never ever actually been there, por supuesto.” <br><br>Dalisay opened her mouth to protest, paused, thought the better of it, and shoved the taffy into her cheek. She chawed away in silence, until Ty produced his spiraling projectiles. The girl instantly slipped under her desk again, spitting the candy into the wrapper just long enough to speak.<br><br>“I didn't do it!”<br><br>“We're escalating? Guys, seriously, we're escalating?” Garth swatted the attack-cup out of the air, and pinned it to his desk. He stood up, and turned to face Ty and Almudena.<br><br>“Maybe I'm the only one who's ever dealt with other Powers before, but escalating is the last thing you ever want to do in the Archipelago. You guys might be used to being the top predator where you come from, but here, we're just guppies in a pond full of sharks,” Garth spread his hands for emphasis. <i>My God, I sound like Terrian...</i> He mulled to himself.<br><br>“Blandengue, you think these people are going to make a school for protecting young powers, a bunch of us <i>guppies</i> and then throw some sharks in with us?” Almudena hunched forward, leaning on her elbow.<br><br>“I'm just saying, in the Archipelago, you never what you're getting into when you start trouble with somebody. It takes prudence, just in case. It's not just courting tourism that makes people so polite around here,” Garth turned away from them, and began making his way back to the refreshment table.<br>“For all you know, even I might be one of those sharks.”<br>-----<br>(Then AFTER Silumas entered the room)<br>Garth rolled three cinnamon coated donut holes onto his napkin, their beige hues popping out against the deep burgundy. Whoever had laid out this spread had sprung extra for seasonal napkins, and then gone with a cheap spread. That meant something, but Garth couldn't quite put his finger on it.<br>Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the female teacher ambling her way over to the table.<br><br>“Ah, hello, Miss?”<br><br>“Russell. Thyra Russell,” The woman pushed her glasses up above her forehead, revealing friendly brown eyes, “No need to worry about the whole Miss or Missus thing. Superintendent will do, Garth.”<br><br>“Superintendent? Wait-” Garth fumbled with his snacks, “You mean that you run this entire project, and you're letting everybody goof around like this?”<br>Thyra smiled, her eyes gleaming.<br><br>“You learn a lot more about what your students will need when you see what they're really like. Think of this as a zookeeper doing field observation, so they know better what their charges will need while under their care.”<br><br>“Zookeeper? That's hardly flattering,” Garth took a nibble of one of the treats, dabbing at the crumbs with his napkin.<br><br>“I've yet to see much evidence to the contrary,” Thyra chuckled, “But maybe that's for the best. After all, conflict is what reveals our true nature.”<br><br>She raised a hand, gesturing towards the bleachers.<br><br>“That's the in-crowd. Lots of bravado, but I'm guessing they struggle with their own self-worth when they're on their own. They'll need to learn independence, one way or another.”<br><br>“And I'm fairly positive that's our loner-rebel,” She pointed towards Talia discretely, “She's got to do the opposite; a life without trust in others is like a plant without roots.”<br><br>“It's a little harder to peg the others, but everybody plays their role,” Thyra lowered her glasses, and turned away from Garth, looking out towards the ocean, “It's just as much an ecosystem as the wilderness. We all have niches we fill, checks and balances that keep things orderly. And just like a zookeeper, my role is to sculpt the system so that every one of you can thrive, even when transplanted so very far from home.”<br><br>“That makes sense,” Garth polished off another donut, and dabbed his lips clean, “Wait, what role do I play?”<br><br>“That's up to you, and you alone,” Though he couldn't see her face, Garth wagered that Thyra was still smiling cryptically, “Personally, I think you've got potential to be a real leader and role model for the other students, but Natalie's got you pegged as, in her words, 'the designated kiss-ass'.”<br><br>“Natalie?” Garth dropped the last donut. It bounced across the floor, leaving a sugary trail as it rolled under the table, “She's not going to be a teacher, is she?”<br><br>“She was under consideration, though at the present time she had to decline, due to the fact that she's already working two jobs.”<br><br>“Natalie has two jobs? What, is she like an assassin, and on the weekends she assassinates assassins or something?” Garth knelt down and crawled beneath the table, to pick up the mess he'd made.<br><br>“Actually, she works as an Insurance Adjustor and Loss Counselor for the Caring Hearts Powers and Supernatural Disaster Insurance Agency,” Thyra noted.<br>Garth hit his head on the table with a yelp.<br><br>“People aren't as one note as you think,” Thyra offered her hand. She pulled Garth to his feet, her rock solid grip steadying him.<br><br>Garth rubbed at the lump on his skull, wincing. He glanced over to where Silumas was glowering.<br><br>“Uh, if we don't have Natalie as the teacher, who <i>are</i> our other teachers?”<br><br>“It's complicated,” Thyra mused, shrugging, “To be completely forthright, we weren't ready to start quite yet, but the Archipelago forced our hand. Our only option was to start before we had everything lined up, or wait until next year for our certification.”<br><br>“Of course, I chose the one that would allow us help the most students as soon as possible.”<br><br>“And... him?” Garth nodded towards Silumas.<br><br>“He comes very highly recommended. I'll discuss it with you later, but I've done my due diligence,” Thyra's smile faded, her jaw set.<br><br>As Garth started to speak, Thyra put a finger to her lips.<br><br>“As I said, I'll discuss it with you later.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia had been aware of most of the conversation throughout the auditorium, but much of it was of little interest to her.  However, when she sensed the conversation between the pale, sickly boy called Garth and a woman identifying herself as the superintendent of the school, she focused her sonic senses on it, wanting to learn what was really going on.<br><br><i>Well, she is right about this being a zoo</i>, she thought to herself.  What troubled her was the fact that Thyra was unwilling to discuss the exact purpose of the evil looking man sitting at the front.  Also <i>how is it that anyone thought it was a good idea to start early before you have everything set up the way you need it to be?  How is that a good idea?</i>  Talia wondered.<br><br>This entire situation had just become exceedingly ridiculous to her and she had to wonder if they even knew anything about her past or her powers and the issues she had with them.<br><br>Talia could also see that Garth was quite sceptical of all this as well and did not seem particularly comfortable himself.  She shut her eyes and began plucking sound waves from the air and focused them at Garth, emulating a generic whisper in his ears.<br><br>“So this is her idea of how a zoo should be operated?  Just throwing a bunch of different animals in the same room together and letting them interact?”  The whisper said while Talia kept her face hidden in her book.<br><br>“Makes me wonder if these people even know about their student’s pasts, what we’re capable of or what might set us off.”<br><br>Talia was aware that Thyra had labeled her the loner rebel, but she was careful not to mention that knowing it would tip Garth off to who was whispering in his ears.<br><br>“Also, what’s the deal with the comic book villain on stage that she won’t talk about, there’s definitely something off about that guy”, the whispers continued.  “If the superintendent lady wants to help us so badly, hiding the truth isn’t the way to do it.”<br><br>“Also, who is this Natalie woman who might be a teacher and why don’t you seem to trust her?

Its pages had been thoroughly marked; names and dates were crossed out.  Flint leaned forward onto his elbow and glanced around the room once again. The large sickly looking guy had wandered off to talk to some woman who had just entered the room.  She claimed to be the superintendent or something like that.  Reaching back into his bag he extracted the small leather bound book again.  Turning the pages slowly he began to examine the superintendent’s face.  “Also not on the list.” He thought.  “Not sure if it would really matter with that guy on the stage though.” <br><br>Glancing at the desk next to him Flint noticed the candy was gone.  The little girl had emerged from her hiding hole and was now nervously chewing on the tantalizing treat.  She was clearly of Asian descent.  However, her country of origin was difficult to guess.  Another outburst of powers, in the skirmish between cliques, sent her retreating back under the desk like a rabbit to its hole.  Sliding out of his chair, Flint sat on the floor between their desks. “No one is blaming you popet.” Flint said as he leaned against his desk.  The floor was cold, but not nearly as cold as home. The chill was almost comforting. <br><br>Something in the room was bothering him.  It had been passively tugging at his mind since shortly after he entered the room.  Until now he had been able to distract himself with altering the history book.  However, that task was finished now and it was the only history book he brought with him. Now his attention was focused on finding the source of his uneasiness.  It was a familiar uneasiness, like it was caused by something he had experienced before.  Slowly scanning the room, Flint’s eyes seemed to peer deeply into everything they passed over.  Finally they came to rest on the authoritative figure sitting in the center of the stage.  Since he had not been on the list Flint had paid little attention to the intimidating man.  However, something about him seemed familiar and haunting. This man was defiantly the source of his uneasiness. “How can someone I haven’t met feel so familiar.” He wondered. “I would definitely have remembered eyebrows that bushy.” <br><br>As he continued to examine the comical villain, Flint reached forward and grabbed the front leg of his desk.  Suddenly a realization fell over him like an avalanche.  The front leg of his desk shattered as his grip rapidly tightened and a sliver of grey appeared in his eyes.  “It’s that smirk, I’ve seen that smirk before.” The sliver of grey vanished as quickly as it had appeared and Flint began to take deep breaths. “Calm down, he is different; he is one of our teachers. I hope.”   Looking back at the desk next to him Flint saw the little girl staring at him.  “No one is blaming you popet.” He repeated as he slid her another piece of candy.<br>	<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">AngelicTragedy</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Escalating?  There was no escalation on Ty's part, or at least that was how he saw it.  In a school social structure, even more so this one, you had to make it clear that you were willing to stand up for yourself of allow yourself to become prey.  Ty would never become prey again.  He'd had his fair share of bullies over the years and refused to let that happen to him again.  A boy by the name of Travis had been the worst of the lot, putting the much younger Ty in the hospital at the age of 10 just for scoring much higher than him on a test.  The test probably wasn't the main cause, but the praise for Ty and the scorn from the teacher laid down on Travis.  Some people just aren't equipped for dealing with such undue judgement.  Ty never forgot that day; the pain of the beating, leaving him with a broken nose and massive bruising, or the mental scarring it had left him with.<br><br>Ty's father had tried to teach him how to fight, pushing his son to stand up for himself in the only language that a real bully understood, but Ty was never cut out for physical violence.  Always small and scrawny for his age, Ty got very little from the martial arts courses his father made him take except bruises and strained muscles.  He always took the path of none violence, using his words to fight back, or when that failed Ty wasn't afraid to call on the aid of his teachers.  This made Ty even more of a target and earned him titles such as pansy, baby cakes, and chicken shit.  None of that really bothered TY, but now he had a chance to make things better for himself like he had promised his dad he would do before leaving for school.  <br><br>Ty truly loved his father but life with him was hard at best.  Ty's father, Allen, was the head of Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge and Bear Mountain Riding Stables &amp; Dude Ranch, leaving very little time for his family.  Allen was a hard man and he had to be.  Working with big cats and running a dude ranch is hard work and Allen expected his children to be able to keep up with him.  Ty never could but his older brother and sister did in spades, seemingly driving a wedge between the father son relationship.  Ty did his best, but as close as he could come to helping with either business was befriending a female tiger named Rayn that had come from a traveling circus.  Ty was the only member of the family that could get close to Rayn and Ty thought that this would be a bonding point for him and his father.  It wasn't.  Allen thought that if Ty could do that with one tiger he should be able to do it with all of them.  He couldn't.  Ty knew that his father tried his best, but sometimes it just didn't seem like it.<br><br>Ty's hand floated up towards the silver plated tiger claw pendant that he wore around his neck, a reminder of home and Rayn that is father had given him before leaving home.  The night before boarding a flight to the Archipelago Allen had called his youngest son outside to talk.  Allen had given him the pendant bound on a leather cord and asked Ty to at least take it with him.  Ty agreed and after a few moments of silence Allen began to tell him of when Ty's mother had first come to the States.  The community at the time was changing and Allen was in love, but being in a smaller Ozarks city racism was still a point of contention.  A few of Allen's closest friends couldn't believe that their buddy was going to marry a Japanese woman, how could he do this to them.  Allen explained that it wasn't about them and told them to leave and never come back.  Allen and his new family became both a topic of conversation and a point of ire.  It was something that Allen did his very best to keep away from his children and it taxed him most days.  Ty was shocked to find out that there were people in his community that viewed his siblings and himself as flawed just because half of their genetics were not the right color.  Ty absorbed the meaning of what his father had said and put on the pendant.  His father really did have the best in mind for Ty, but didn't know how to deal with the situation.  Allen was dealing with forces on the outside trying to tell him that he was wrong to love someone of another color, that his children were monsters, and now his youngest had changed so drastically that he may well be.  Ty silently hugged his father and went back inside to finish packing.<br><br><i>Dad, I think I understand now.  You were trying to prepare me for something like this and I won't let you down.</i><br><br>Ty pulled his attention away from his thoughts and glanced around the room again.  A few more students hand joined the crowd since the last time he had looked.  A boy blanking out a text book, a girl to one side reading, a boy taking fevered notes.  None of them appeared to be to worrying, but one could never tell.  Turning back forward in his desk Ty spotted the dark man at the front and studied him as best he could.  He had money, that much was clear, but there was something off about him.  He seemed to be larger than life, like he was to big for being anywhere but on a throne or at the head of an army.  If it weren't for his massive eyebrows Ty would have been so put off by his appearance that he would have thought that someone had put an evil wax sculpture at the front of the room.<br><br><i>What is the deal with this guy?</i> Ty thought to himself as he continued to play with his plated tiger claw.<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“I didn't do anything wrong...” Dalisay slowly stood up, and warily sat back down at her desk, “But I'm the one who gets blamed for everything.”<br><br>“That's how it is,” She sighed, dusting off the knees of her overalls. Ignoring the second piece of candy, the girl rested her cheeks on her hands and slouched forwards, squishing her face.<br><br>“Those pests that follow me around cause trouble. Even when I'm perfect, especially when I'm perfect, they ruin everything. And now, everybody's so used to those-” Dalisay paused, her eyes darting left and right cautiously.<br><br>“Those <i>butts</i> wrecking everything that when ANYTHING goes wrong, everybody points at me.”<br><br>“Hey, nina, cheer up!” Almudena reached behind herself and tousled the younger girl's hair, her desk teetering precariously on its back two legs.<br><br>“Tell ya what, Dallas. I'll make sure to wreck some stuff too, so all those jerks will have somebody to point at besides you.”<br><br>Almudena leaned forward, her desk hitting the floor hard enough that it bounced up before crashing down.<br><br>Garth, already quizzically glancing about from Talia's message, nearly jumped out of his skin when Almudena started slamming the furniture around. The youth shakily tossed his napkin towards the trash, and missed.<br><br>With a cordial nod towards Thyra, he turned and walked away. As he knelt to pick up his garbage, he muttered to himself.<br><br>“I'm not adverse to calling this a zoo, considering that's basically what I was calling it <i>before</i> I talked with Thyra. And I'm not sure they know all of our pasts, but...”<br><br>Garth paused, and licked his lips.<br><br>“I think we can handle whatever happens here.”<br><br>He waited as the whispers spieled on about the teacher on the stage. Slowly, something dawned on him and a wide grin spread across his face.<br><br>“Ohhh, you clever dog you. Of course, you presumed I'd think you were one of the students, put me through my paces, and see where I stood on you before classes even started. And I doubt you got hired here without knowing Natalie, so you're either trying to cover your tracks, or you want me to embarrass myself by saying something stupid about her. Nice prank, but you've gotta try harder than that to get me.”<br><br>Garth tossed his napkin into the garbage triumphantly, and sprung to his feet. He strode purposefully up to the edge of the stage, and took the steps two at a time. As he reached the top , he paused, wheezing for breath. He looked out towards the entire class, purposefully, and managed to stiffle his gasps.<br><br>He began making his way across the stage, until he found the seat next to Silumas. He threw himself into the chair nonchalantly. Leaning over, he amicably slapped the teacher on the back.<br><br>“So, how's it going, buddy?”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Silumas</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><i>Disney.<br><br><br>Comic Book.<br><br></i><br><br><i>My research was...incomplete it appears.</i> Silumas pondered to himself as he looked out upon the students assembled before him. When he and Thyra had finally come to an agreement for him to begin teaching at the school, Silumas had decided to do some studying on what the modern Earthling child would find authoritative and respectful. Apparently, sarcasm and caricature were a popular cultural trope of this plane. <br><br><br>Silumas had not had the time he wanted to absorb the nuances of this plane, and it had caused him some embarrassment. Humiliation was not something the Dark One was used to, and it did not set him within the best of moods. With his rising temper, the thermostat in the room had been rising a few degrees as well. With the unconscious summoning of Fire and Death, which were Silumas' go-to elements for ridding himself of inconveniences, the auditorium found itself warming uncomfortably.<br><br><br>"So, how's it going, buddy?"  spoke an insolent little whelp, plopping into the seat next to the Dark One. Then, Garth chose, nay dared, to place his hand upon the greatest, most powerful Elementalist this or any other plane had ever seen.<br><br><br>Slowly, carefully, the magician turned his head to look upon the student named Garth. His eyes were no longer the bright green or deep brown, instead they glowed with a menacing flame, a ruby color both bright and foreboding. Once Silumas had locked eyes with the kid, the Dark One's nostrils flared. A swift breeze picked up within the large space of the room, gathering at him, whipping his suit around. That same air concentrated around Garth's torso, grabbing him tightly like the fist of a giant with a not-so-careful grip.<br><br><br>The Magus stood slowly, his posture loose though his fists clenched in barely contained rage, his gaze locked upon Garth. Silumas turned slowly to face the rest of the student body, and as he did Garth was manhandled from the chair to stay in front of the caster. It was hard to tell when his refined suit of black and red dissolved and was replaced. His new garb was something far more impressive, far older, and far more Silumas' own style. A flowing robe of black silk, loose and easily moved within, sleeves down past his hands when at his sides but now they bunched between elbow and wrist. On the cowl, intricate patterns of skulls, moors,  and pestilence were etched in patterns of a dark metal, and seemed to constantly change and move. That movement was a constant amongst the robe's patterns.<br><br><br>On Silumas' torso was a bright white thread in patterns of plants, animals, and people. Symbols of health and nature. His right arm was colored in red silk with the image of a constant flame, flickering with shades of orange giving the illusion of true fire. The left arm was ensconced in images of cliffs, mountains, and plains in a dark brown and light tans. His left leg held various and shifting shades of blue in running rivers and ocean currents. Silumas' right leg was the final difference among the shades, containing the images of a howling wind in yellow.<br><br><br>"Faculty. Only." Silumas spoke, whispering, though his voice carried along the billowing air current now filling the room, pushing his voice out to the rest of the room.<br><br><br>With that, Silumas casually flicked his wrist out tossing Garth back into the auditorium proper, and into a chair. He did so with such force Garth and the chair were pushed back several yards and he almost toppled over. Silumas, however, made a point to grab the front chair legs with the same wind and slam them into the auditorium floor, cracking and crater-ing it a good inch.<br><br><br>Finally, the goatee melted away, along with the bushy eyebrows. The Magus' hair similarly seemed to vanish leaving him with a bald, well-kept scalp, and thin, almost manicured hair above his eyes. The wood beneath the teacher's feet smoked with the Fire mana leaving his will though thankfully nothing sparked fire. Cowl finally put into place, Silumas retook his seat, fingers placed back into the steeple they were before. <br><br><br><i>Wretched children.<br></i><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">As Talia had guessed, Garth was unable to tell that it was her whispering in his ear.  However, she could not have guessed what happened next.  She felt the words coming from his mouth and understood until he suddenly got the idea that the comic book villain on stage was the one whispering his ear.<br><br>She watched as the pale, sickly boy marched on stage and she froze with astonishment before she was able to redirect his suspicions.  What occurred next between the two on stage was enough to strike fear into anyone in the auditorium, powers or no.  Talia quickly hid her face in her book once more after the man’s appearance changed and Garth was flung back into his seat.<br><br><i>Well, that was unexpected</i> she thought to herself as she peered back over the top of her book, taking in the new image of the man on stage.  <i>Ok, so he’s terrifying, had that part right, but...oh god, now he looks like someone tore a bunch of pages out of a coloring book</i> she sighed to herself, smacking her face between the pages of the book.<br><br>Not only was he suspicious, terrifying and not to be trusted, as if all of that wasn’t enough, she still couldn’t take him seriously despite it all.  <i>Who dresses like that?

Based on the silence that'd fallen over his friends, they were all thinking the same thing. In fact it felt like the entire room was holding its breath, waiting to see how the teacher would respond.<br><br><i>That was not what I was expecting</i> the teacher stood up and the kid looked like someone had his entire chest in a vice, and the wind was spreading, he could feel his jacket shifting and flapping. A bead of sweat dripped down his forehead and out of the corner of his eye he saw Evelyn open her pocket mirror again but he couldn't make his gaze leave the pair on the stage. The guy's clothes were changing now, and his face and his hair <i>now that's a neat trick, how much money does he save on clothes and haircuts?</i> The suit faded away... no it looked like it was melting into something else, dripping and turning into flowing material and colours and patterns, his eyebrows were shrinking and his head was rapidly balding but not shedding. There was a lot going on and as <i>they're robes, who wears robes</i> his robes billowed in the wind, Carlos could make out small details like the peak of a mountain or the beak of a hawk but never for more than a second.<br><br>The kid suddenly flew across the room and it didn't look like he'd wanted to, or was even expecting it and Jay was on his feet again, so was Mel, but Carlos sunk further into his seat and pulled his knees up on a reflex. The chair that the kid had landed in screeched and grated as it slid across the auditorium floor and the noise cut through him <i>this is way worse than polystyrene</i> and it looked like it was threatening to tip over with the kid still sat in it but the front legs slammed down suddenly, the sound echoing in the room. He vaguely noted the boy in blue and gold rushing toward the wimp to make sure he was okay. Looking at what had happened, if he was being completely honest, yeah, they'd been messing with the other kids but it was just pranks. <i>That looked like an outright attack.</i><br><br>Mel was the first one to recover. "I could've done that," she said with a shrug, slipping back into her seat with a sort-of grace, and Jay let out a nervous laugh, collapsing heavily back into his seat.<br><br>"Thoughts, Carlos?" Evelyn asked and he could hear the curiosity in his voice but whether it was genuine or faked, he couldn't tell. It wasn't a question about what had happened. It was Evelyn trying to calm him down. He took a second to look the teacher over again. <br><br>"Did we travel back to the middle ages? Are we in a church full of monks? Do you see anyone else here wearing robes?" He replied, uncurling his body after a moment and resting his feet on the seat in front again. "And aesthetics, I get it, there's a <i>theme</i> there but he's mixing his patterns. It's like, rule number one, don't mix patterns."<br><br>Evelyn nodded approvingly and Carlos felt a bit of tension bleed out of his shoulders. <i>Fashion, fashion is safe</i>.<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Sure, he didn't sound quite as ostentatious as his colleague but he figured the sound of his flip-flops alternating between slapping his feet and the linoleum floor was loud enough that he'd attract at least some attention. Walking the corridors felt familiar and alien at the same time; had everything felt this small when he was a teenager? Or had he simply grown a lot more than he thought as he'd grown up? He adjusted the messenger bag slung over his shoulder and pushed the door open to the auditorium.<br><br><i>I was always a bit short for the basketball team,</i> he thought to himself as he noted the hoops at either end of the room. Might be a different story nowadays, though it was kind of a moot point at this stage. The room was steadily filling up and he noted the different groups that were forming among the students already, <i>I give it a week before they start mingling further,</i> he thought to himself before taking in what was happening in the room. A lot of eyes kept on flicking towards Silumas and one of the students, a frail looking kid with blonde hair. Frowning, he looked down at the floor. Deep grooves lined the floor for a good few meters and the ground was slightly blackened, like it was threatening to catch fire. He looked back up at Silumas and clocked the change in clothes. When he'd seen the other teacher earlier, he'd been wearing a black and red suit, all flashy and clearly a deliberate attempt to look intimidating. Now he was wearing robes and a cowl, intricate patterns across all the different folds in the material. <br><br>He'd walked in on <i>something</i>, even if he didn't quite know what. The air was warm and heavy and there was a hint of a breeze that ruffled his brown hair. Every eye was on either Silumas or the kid, Garth his mind supplied, barely anyone had even noticed him slip into the room.<br><br>So much for wearing flip-flops to get attention.<br><br>Watching the scene was a woman he recognised, brow furrowed in a small frown. She turned as he approached and plastered on a smile. There was something forced there, though, the smile not quite meeting her eyes like a genuine one would.<br><br>"Mr Ginnungap," she greeted, her smile threatening to become a smirk as she extended her hand.<br><br>"Miss Russell," Kilik replied, grasping her hand and flashing a good-natured grin. "Or is that Superintendent now? Should I courtsey?"<br><br>"Courtseying might be a bit far, you wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea." <br><br>"Let's stick with Kilik then, 'Ginnungap' gets to be a bit of a mouthful after a while."<br><br>Truth be told, he could count on one hand how many times he'd met Thyra and didn't even need his hands to count how many proper conversations they'd had. It was more one of those friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend situations, six degrees of separation and all that. Powers in the Archipelago all pretty much knew each other anyway, or at least knew someone who knew someone and unless someone had really managed to offend someone else, they were friendly with each other as a general rule. Or, at least, that was Kilik's take on it. He felt like he was asking about people's job references sometimes. He lost track of how many times he'd had to gauge whether he wanted to work with someone based on a mutual friend's opinion of them. Even so, it had still be a surprise when he'd answered the phone and was offered a teaching position at the school.<br><br>"So I'm curious, not that I'm not grateful for this opportunity," Kilik said casually, shoving his hands into the pockets of his board shorts. "Of all the guys you could have picked, what made you choose me? I can list at least a dozen guys who'd jump at the chance to teach these kids."<br><br>"Honestly? Dependability," Thyra responded with a shrug. "You know how most Powers are, always looking to jump into quests and adventures and getting tangled up with organized crime and the like. While that might be fun and all, we need some people who are willing to hold down the fort, to be a rock for our students day in and day out. And honestly, how many Powers do you know who you could actually say that about? Personally, I think that what we've got here is the hardest quest, and potentially, the greatest reward that somebody could ever ask for."<br><br>"That's true. Trust is always an issue," Kilik agreed, nodding. "Sometimes you've gotta trust your friends to deal with something when you can't. But yeah, I've read the dossiers on some of these kids. Some of them have come from some really messed up backgrounds, haven't they? It feels like they need more help than any of them are ready to admit. Not everyone needs their life saving in order to really be helped, these kids need us just as much as someone in a burning building."<br><br>Thyra hummed in agreement and the pair turned their attention back to the rest of the room.<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SV</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">The clangor from the chair was still reverberating in the high ceilings of the gymnasium when the girl named Dalisay felt a tap on her arm. She wheeled around and found herself face to face with a  girl with bushy hair, about her age.<br><br>"Can I sit with you?" the girl asked. She cast her hazel eyes warily in the direction of the stage. "That man scares me."<br><br>Without waiting for a response, she clambered into an adjacent desk and pushed it closer with a sneakered foot, trying with a kiddish surreptitiousness  to keep its feet from scuffing too loudly against the hardwood floor.

A fine, iridescent smoke wafted up from all around him, seemingly pouring off of his skin.<br><br>“Ugh, whyyy?” Garth whinged, feebly dragging himself upright.<br><br>“Why? Because you saw el diablo, and decided to grab him by the tail,” Almudena retorted, getting up from her seat and pacing over to the edge of the crater, “Gotta give it to you, though, Furball. You've got some serious huevos.”<br><br>“No, no...” Garth let out a frustrated grunt, shifting his hands to cover his eyes, “What I'm wondering is why it's always, ALWAYS bald guys. First, Nachoset, then the Lama, and now this. From now on, I'm avoiding the oncology wing in hospitals, so some six-year old with leukemia doesn't mangle me.”<br><br>Almudena crouched down til she was at head level with him.<br><br>“If nachos and llamas are beating you up, I've got a couple of questions, too.”<br><br>Garth sighed exasperatedly. He went to stand up, and his knees gave way, throwing him back into his seat. A strong hand took hold of his forearm, and slowly guided him to his feet.<br><br>The youth glanced around, disoriented, until he realized that a stranger had helped him up. The boy was around his age, dressed in blue and gold with a friendly smile.<br><br>“Hey, thanks,” Garth dusted himself off, brushing off splinters of wood and flecks of paint from the shattered floor, “Garth, by the way.

As the impact echoed, a young woman lowered her flip-flop clad foot, and stepped into the room. She was carrying a massive tray of cupcakes in one hand, balanced in the crook of her arm. From each ear, obnoxiously large and shiny apple earrings dangled, which the more fashion conscious observer would recognize as clip-ons. Her hair was pulled  into a tight brown ponytail, swishing behind her with every movement.<br><br>She took a glance around the gym to orient herself, her brilliant orange track pants and yellow apron making her shine like a beacon. Upon noticing the students nearby on the bleachers, her eyes narrowed and her smile widened. The woman took three steps up to the bleachers, and threw the tray of cupcakes over her head.<br><br>Placing her hand on one of the lower seats, she cartwheeled up onto the benches, catching the tray in the middle of her rotation. She landed on her feet, the cupcakes still completely intact and undisturbed.<br><br>“Hold this. Thanks!” She shoved the tray into Jay's grip, and began stepping her way up to the very top tier of the benches. The woman cupped her hands in front of her mouth.<br><br>“HELLO EVERYBODY, AND WELCOME TO THE TERMINER ACADEMY FOR EXCEPTIONAL YOUTH, OR TAFEY, WHICH I PERSONALLY PREFER BECAUSE IT SOUNDS YUMMIER!

She turned to Jay, and plucked the tray out of his grasp.<br><br>“Thanks again, that was really sweet of you!” Emily beamed even harder, “And speaking of sweet, I made cupcakes for everybody! I made each one special, after reading through all the files.”<br><br>Her smile shrank one iota.<br><br>“Of course, they didn't list the most important thing, what everybody's favorite kind of cupcake is, so I had to guess on that front. I mean, really, what kind of madhouse is this? I'll have to bring this up at the next board meeting.”<br><br>She threw her leg up on the step above her, and balanced the tray across her knee.<br><br>“I'm guessing you're Evelyn, right?” Emily nodded to the dark haired girl, “I made this one for you!”<br><br>Emily plucked a shimmering silvery cupcake with gleaming clear sugar crystals sprinkeled over its frosting. She handled it delicately, despite her prior haste, as she passed it to the fashionista.<br><br>“It's angelfood cake, with whipped cream frosting. I thought about making a glow in the dark one, but then I realized it would be morning, and glow in the dark would kinda... not.”<br><br>Emily helicoptered the tray across her knee, and plucked another treat from the whirling flurry of colours.<br><br>“Ah, Jamall?” She regarded the largest of the students, tilting her head and smiling. The apples swung and bobbed violently, “I thought since you're so strong, I should make you a really powerful cupcake. So I used a pound cake mix, pineapples, and just a touch of rum for flavor.” <br><br>She offered him a cupcake topped with thinly sliced piece of pineapple and a cherry, drizzled with caramel sauce in an intricate swirl.<br><br>“Don't worry, the alchohol cooks out! I'm not going to get all our students drunk before the first day of school!”<br><br>Emily set the tray down as she made her way around Jay. She approached the girl with the lavender hued hair, and nodded to her.<br><br>“I know you're Mel! Unless you're actually one of our other students and you dyed your hair purple the day before school, or maybe one of our students is a shapeshifter, and they're pretending to be Mel! In which case I should warn you that ripping off Mel's fashion like that is downright unsavory,” Emily pursed her lips in thought, “But I'm guessing you probably are Mel.”<br><br>She regarded the girl's flat expression.<br><br>“I'd give you a cupcake, but I didn't make one for you,” Emily shrugged, showing her empty palms.<br><br>“Just kidding!” The baker twisted her hand, seemingly pulling the cake from thin air, “It's a magic trick! Cool, right?”<br><br>She pushed the treat into Mel's hands. It had been delicately frosted white, with a shimmering ribbon that looked like satin but was crafted from pulled sugar tied into a bow on top of it.<br><br>“I didn't know what would be a good flavor for you, so I just went with orange-spice. You like cinnamon, right?” Emily observed Mel's reaction for only a moment before she bounced away, skipping off the bench above and landing on the far side of Carlos.<br><br>“And I'm guessing you're... Carl?” Emily scooped up the tray, dipping it so that one cupcake popped into the air. She snapped it up, and offered it to him, twirling it on her fingertip.<br><br>“I tried making a computer out of a cupcake, but-” Emily sighed forlornly, “I couldn't get it to run Windows. Vista, right?”<br><br>She slowed  the cupcake down, rolling it around her wrist and into her palm in a singular smooth motion. Emily tipped it towards him, “So I did this instead.”<br><br>The top of the cupcake had half a dozen cogs made out of wafers and frosted silver. Emily took her fingertip and gently pushed at a tooth of one of the gears, and it interlocked with the others, slowly turning all of them.<br><br>“Technically, it's a machine! Though I don't know if you can talk with it, or whatever it is you can do with that stuff,” Emily leaned in close, and whispered conspiratorially, her earrings bopping him on the cheek.<br><br>“If it tells you not to eat it, don't listen! I think it's biased!”<br><br>Standing again, she scooped up the tray.<br><br>“It's lemon flavored with a lemon pudding filling. It's not electricity, but it's the closest I could come up with!”<br><br>“Enjoy!”<br><br>With that, Emily jumped off the top tier of the bleacher, her cupcakes balanced on top of her head.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">The sound of splintering wood drew Flint’s attention to the middle of the room.  A small wind drifted through the room as the sickly looking boy from earlier crashed into a chair.  Standing up, Flint adjusted his sweater and looked to the stage.  The man with bushy eyebrows had transformed into a much more intimidating presence.  Perhaps it was his new clothes with the shifting patterns that made him more intimidating, or maybe it was because the bushy eyebrows had become thinned and well kept.  Either way the man on stage was no longer smirking.  His face radiated anger at the boy who dared touch him, yet Flint felt his unease disappear as the smirk faded into a snarl. <br><br>“I should probably go see if he is okay.” Flint muttered to himself as he walked toward the center of the room stopping next to the loud tan girl.  “Do you think he is the bravest one here or the stupidest?” he asked her. “My name is Flint by the way.”	<br><br>Dancing around the room, the wind carried a small sound into Flint’s ears.  It was faint but he could here flip flops approaching the door.  “I wonder if it’s another staff or a student.” He thought to himself.  His back was turned to the door as it burst open and the sound of flip flops become louder.  Something about the sound annoyed Flint.  It seemed joyful and jittery.  “It’s almost like….. Wait, no it can’t be.” The words had barely gone through his mind before Emily’s chipper voice filled the room.  “I should have “accidentally” shot her when I had the chance. I hope she burned those pictures” He thought as he groaned. “Now I have to listen to that voice all year; maybe she brought more gummy worms though.”<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">The view was good. Great, even. Rolling waves and the sun shining through the clouds, the line of the horizon nearly merging into a wall of blue. Gulls soared lazily and ships that must have been hundreds of feet long passed silenly. A breeze was rustling the trees, the grass making waves of its own, vines shuddering where they climbed rocks. He could probably spend hours watching that view. Hell, if they ever actually got to play basketball in the auditorium, he'd probably be too distracted by the view to play properly. He kind of wished he'd brought a basketball with him, now that he thought about it. Oh well. The view was serene and, despite the prank-war that looked like it was grinding to a halt (which was kind of a shame, he was enjoying watching it), he was pretty content.<br><br>So obviously, when another student was blasted across the room by a teacher, saying he was a bit shocked would have been a monumental understatement.<br><br>He clocked the teacher's dramatic, maybe a bit over-dramatic, change in clothes (and it shouldn't really have surprised him but still kind of did) as he made his way through the desks to the student who'd been thrown. If it'd been one of the other students, like the loud hispanic girl or maybe the bulky guy in leather on the bleachers, he wouldn't have been too concerned, they looked like they'd be able to take it, guy on the bleachers probably would have deserved it. The kid who'd been thrown, though, he looked like he'd crumble under a stiff breeze. Actually, in a way, that was exactly what had happened now that he thought about it. As he stumbled, Ben swung his arm out and caught the smaller boy's arm, steadying him. He flashed a winning smile as the other kid brushed the debris from his clothes.<br><br>"Ben," he greeted, extending his hand. "Nice to meet you."<br><br>As he'd expected, Garth's handshake wasn't nearly as firm as his own. He still looked a bit rattled and Ben reached out to brush a bit of dust that Garth had missed from his shoulder (and he should probably be careful since, again, the kid looked like he might collapse at any sudden force). He nodded to the girl stood with them, and down to the two kids, probably third, maybe fourth graders.<br><br>He kept the smile on his face as he turned back to Garth and asked, "So, I've gotta ask, what on earth made you walk up to the scariest looking person in the room and act all buddy-buddy with him?"<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Carlos would have laughed at Jay's expression when he had the tray of cakes thrust at him if he hadn't been so stunned by the woman's appearance and energy <i>she's like the cautionary story of why not to drink energy drinks, Jesus Christ</i>. She was all bounding energy and enthusiasm and pretty impressive acrobatics, how the hell she kept all those cakes balanced on that tray was a magical mystery and he felt a bit dizzy trying to keep track of the colours as she moved. She was loud and saying something about favourite cupcakes and board meetings and he sort of wished he had headphones or ear plugs or something to drown her out because that was a level of chirpiness that could get really annoying, really <i>really</i> quickly.<br><br><i>This is gonna end in disaster</i> she was now handing out the cupcakes apparently and he could see Evelyn purse her lips again as she was handed a sparkling cupcake, apparently torn between confusion and apprehension and holding the cake at arm's length. She'd muttered a "thanks" but somehow Carlos even cared if this hyperactive if she got a thank you or not since she was already moving down the line. Evelyn was looking at the cupcake warily and he couldn't say he blamed her <i>she's probably put like coke or something in there, that's why she's so bouncy, she's high as a kite</i>. He stopped himself from laughing when Jay cringed at being called by his full first name, Carlos didn't completely know but he was pretty sure only his dad had ever used his full name, but as he accepted his cake, Carlos noted that one of the woman's earrings was missing. Jay shot him a smirk behind the woman's back before shoving half of the treat into his mouth.<br><br>She was saying something about shape-shifters <i>was that a pun? Unsavory? Did that count as a pun?</i> There was an awkward moment, Carlos could see where it was going already <i>oh look she's magicked up a cake for Mel, no one's seen that trick before</i> and he shared Mel's unimpressed expression, she was probably already trying to think up a rhyme that'd really mess with Miss-I-Don't-Know-Anything-About-Contrasting-Colours and he couldn't say he'd want to stop her. Like Evelyn, she was treating the snack with caution though Mel was probably more concerned about, like, poison or something. She was turning it in her hand and yeah, it was a pretty cake, they all were in their own way even if Little-Miss-Loud had managed to get Mel's aesthetic completely wrong. Actually, swap Mel's and Evelyn's cakes. That was a match.<br><br><i>What decade are you living in, a Vista joke, right</i> he didn't even try to make his smile look anything other than forced, he definitely wasn't going to show that he was impressed with her dexterity spinning the cake, but accepted it all the same. The woman nudged one of the silver cogs on the top of the cake and it set the chain reaction off, all the cogs moving and he felt the fake smile fall off his face because that was actually kind of cool. Ignoring her exit, he examined the way the cogs fit together and nudged a different one instead, some kind of wafer biscuit or something, they'd probably crumble if he used too much force but they were all linked in the right ways. Curiously, he pulled one cog off and moved another and there was still movement. Out of the corner of her eye, he saw Evelyn and Jay smirking at him. Ignoring them, he took a bite out of the cake.<br><br>"This thing tastes like diabetes," he said around a mouthful, grimacing. He liked candy and chocolate, sure, maybe even more so than the next kid, but it was like the woman had taken every single ounce of her hyperactivity and weaponized it in her baking, sickly sweet and not remotely what he was expecting. What flavour had she said it was, lemon pudding or something, he didn't know until that exact moment that he hated lemon. Best to ignore the woman's advice because he sure as well wasn't eating it. He pulled the rest of the cogs from the cake and tossed the rest to Jay. </div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">AngelicTragedy</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Ty hand to restrain himself as the sickly boy was thrown like a rag doll through the air and into a desk.  Every instinct told him that he should either do something and if not to run because this teacher was far from someone that Ty wanted to trust his education to.  Ty didn't move.  The hispanic girl and the thus far inactive boy had the pale boy under control and no one seemed to be willing to confront the now robe-clad teacher, even the other staff.  Ty won't be the one to start the fight, but he felt that if it came to it he would be hardly any use.  Ty's abilities had potential to be used in an offensive manner but he hadn't quite figured that out beyond tossing liquids.<br><br>The tension in the room was so thick it was nearly suffocating, that was until the rainbow clad woman pranced into the gym and began passing cupcakes out among the clique in the bleachers.  Ty felt his chest loosen and breathe can more easily.  The staff member who cried her name as 'Emily Schwartzwald' and began talking so rapid fire had taken a bit of the edge off the room.  A bit, but not much.  Ty was still worried about the man on stage and what he was here for.  Was this what he could expect from all the teachers or what this guy a loose cannon?  Either way, Ty thought that the next few days would be interesting.<br><br>*  *  *  *  *  *  *<br><br>As Emily danced into the assembled students the door silently slipped open once again allowing a tall figure of a drastic contrast to slip in mostly unnoticed.  Whereas Emily was clad in riotous colors this man was dressed in much more subdued tones, even though the style of dress couldn't be compared.  The man was thin, but strapping, and appeared to be poised for quick action.  The man wore a robe, not unlike samurai garb, split at the spine between coal black on his left side and dimigray on the right.  The right side of the rope was accented by winding designs that appeared to be lifelike snakes embroidered in thistle-colored thread at the hims of both sleeve and bottom.  The man cast his dull gray gaze across the assembled students and staff, judging the threat that they each posed.  Nimble fingers clenched into fists and crossed across his armored chest.  From waist to neck the figure wore an elaborate breastplate that seemed to be shaped from a single piece of bronze.  There were no flat surfaces on the armor, every inch of the piece was carved into an incredibly sculpted Medusa head.  Hissing serpents rippled away from a beautiful woman's face just over the man's heart.<br><br><i>This is going to be much harder than I ever thought it would be.  I don't see how watching over these children is going to help me finish my training.  Lord Lorsha must have a reason for it I suppose.</i><br><br>The figure watched Emily weave through the bleachers handing out treats with a slight expression of exasperation and mild disgust.  This would be the woman that he had to partner with in supervising the student body and there was no one more opposite of him on staff.  A headache was already brewing at the front of his skull and signs were that this was going to be a daily occurrence.  The man spotted a face he was advised to find and began across the floor, cutting among the desks, without making eye contact with the youths around him.  A few sure strides brought the figure to stand before Thyra.  The man placed his hands flat on his thighs and he bowed deeply before the woman his master had asked him to see.<br><br>"Lady Thyra, my master Valon Lorsha sends his regards.  He is quite excited for what the two of you discussed and hopes that all can be put into place in time.  It's my honor to finally meet someone that my master speaks so highly of.  My name is Marius Solidad and I've come to formally accept my appointment among your staff."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">There was a moment of silence from those in the hallway as they were greeted with the sound of Emily's enthusiasm in the auditorium. They had all made it to the school just in time from the airport.  Those delays were no joke. <br><br>Belwyn Truid didn't know why she was so surprised to hear the levels of Emily's excitement, but it caught her off guard every time.  It had been a while since they'd last spoken. Maybe she could still get some of those pictures from her. <br><br>“I told you it wouldn't be so bad, Eira! The adults give you sweets here! This is going to be amazing!” The lilt from the young boy vibrated with excitement as he spoke to his sister. Belwyn looked down at the two with a light smile. Both children had dark red, curly hair, his short and her's long. Freckles dotted across each pale nose. He was definitely the most lively one in the bunch. Then again, she had only known them for a few hours.  She would undoubtedly learn more as their shyness wore off.   <br><br>“I thought you liked cold treats better.” Eira replied skeptically.<br><br>“Never refuse sugar. Unless it's poisoned...and then you still take it anyway, but discreetly dump it in the bushes.” Her brother countered, his finger pointing at her seriously. <br><br>“What ever you say, Aodhan.” The girl rolled her eyes, but a smile finally played on her lips as she held   her brother's hand. Aodhan ruffled her hair. <br><br>“Hey! No! Not on the first day of school!” She swatted his hand away with a scowl and proceeded to pat down the new flyaways.  <br><br>“Here.” Said one of the older girls as she offered Eira her grey poor-boy hat. She had been planning to hide her own snow white hair with it, but her eyebrows and eyelashes would still show anyway. “It'll go well with your cloths and it even brings out your eyes.”  <br><br>Harue had gone to a regular public school most of her life until a fateful beating and bloody nose. Maybe looks weren't so important here? She twirled the dyed bright yellow and red tips of her hair in her fingers nervously.  They were all powers here after all. <br><br>“Umm... Thanks...” Eira accepted the hat hesitantly, but fixing it onto her head. They hadn't really talked much on the way there despite Miss Truid's prompting. Well, her brother had and occasionally the other light brown haired girl who would randomly break out in giggles or soft whispers. She seriously doubted that one's mental health. It seemed one of those random times was now as the older girl giggled in Eira's direction. <br><br>“Oh... No. I wasn't laughing at you, Red.” Jesse said louder when realizing how it could have been interpreted. “The hat looks great.” She rung her hands nervously and continued whispering subconsciously. “DJ, cut it out. I'm in the school now. That might not even be a thing here. Stop encouraging her, AJ!”<br><br>“So... if you girls are done... I would like my cupcake now!!” With the last part said in a hurry, Aodhan grabbed his sister's hand again and dashed into the auditorium. “Miss Emily! You didn't forget us did you!?” <br><br>Eira hid her face in her free hand. She wasn't necessarily embarrassed by her brother, she was used to him, she just didn't like new people in general. And there was allot of new people.   <br><br>Belwyn now stood in the doorway with the other two girls smiling behind her hand. It was kind of nice to see kids who could actually be kids for once. If all went well she would only be treating a few bumps and bruises this year as the school nurse. She knew that that was very unlikely, but one could dream.<br><br>Harue didn't miss a beat, walking confidently into the room. She even relaxed slightly at the sight of another student with naturally white hair there. Her cheeks colored a bit. Maybe she wouldn't be so different here after all.  Hair bobbed slightly as she plopped down in her seat next to the other two middle school girls.  <br><br>“He was like that the whole way here.” She motioned her head to the twins still standing in front. “I'm, Harue.” She held out her hand to them as Jesse sat down nervously in the seat next to her. <br><br>“You'll be fine. We'll talk later.” Jesse mumbled irritatedly and proceeded to straighten her light blue top. Looking up, she glanced around the room as if noticing where she was for the first time. “Huh.” She shrugged as the nervousness seemed to disappear. “Did we introduce ourselves yet? I'm, Jesse.” Harue's hand was taken in a enthusiastic hand shake.  Harue looked back at the two other girls with an uneasy smile. <br><br>“And she's pretty much been like that the whole way too.” <br><br>“Oh my gosh... I introduced myself the whole way here? I'm so sorry!” Jesse looked slightly mortified. “We'll just cut to the chase then. Mica, Dalisay and Harue right?” She finished with a sheepish wave.<br><br>“Yeah...?” Harue checked for any head injuries on the girl.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“I'd say brave and stupid are the same thing, except I don't really care for what that says about somebody as brave as me,” Almudena pressed her thumb to to her lips in thought, her fingers cradling her chin. <br><br>“What made me do it?” Garth glanced over to Almudena and Flint, “I guess you could say it's because I'm the bravest, stupidest guy in the room. Thanks guys.”<br><br>He looked Ben in the eyes for a moment, before glancing towards the floor and blushing.<br><br>“This is going to sound totally crazy, but I heard a voice. Somebody was whispering in my ear, and going on and on about that guy up there... so I figured it had to be him trying to get my attention,” Garth shook his head, “I took a gamble. If it had been him, I'd have impressed him and everybody else in the room. As is-”<br><br>“I'm impressed!” Almudena clapped her hands loudly, “You're the first student I've seen who can fly!”<br><br>“<i>Thanks,</i> Almudena,” Garth grunted. Keeping his gaze narrowed, he glanced over his shoulder to the crowd on the bleachers.<br><br>“I'm just trying to figure out who it is that whispered in my ear...”<br>----<br>“Ah, hello, Marius. Thyra Russell, Superintendent, as you well know. It's a pleasure to meet you,” Thyra warmly shook his hand, “It's good to have you here, and you're not a moment too soon.”<br><br>She discretely nodded towards Garth's crater.<br><br>“I assume that you're the Boy's Dean and Groundskeeper that Valon told me was inbound. He couldn't say enough about the distinction of your service in Drakengrad and how much morale you inspired in their military. Hopefully, now that you're here to help keep order, the destruction will slow down a bit.”<br><br>“So far we've got a broken chair, damaged floor, and a shattered leg on a desk,” Thyra uncoiled a crescent of silver from around her wrist, and laid it across her palm. The inside of the arch lit up, projecting a display across her hand. The superintendent quickly tapped in a few bits of data, the holographic readout blinking with each touch.<br><br>“The damage to the floor won't actually be an issue; Sly and an outside design consultant, Nick Tauric, I believe he was called, installed a smart nanoweave into both the gymnasium and the rooftop field. So the floor should restore itself before tomorrow morning. As for the chairs and desks, whenever one gets damaged, we've got a spare supply in the basement. Assuming we average one of each broken a day, we've got enough stockpiled to last us for the next three school years.”<br><br>“I mean, honestly, the damages so far are actually substantially less than what we projected, and I'm not quite certain if that shows preparedness on our part, or if that's an indication of the impossibility of the task ahead of us, but either way, this is where the rubber meets the road.”<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler8155010').toggle();if($('#spoiler8155010').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler8155010">OOC:Expect a huge Emily post soon!</div></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia had gone back to actually reading her book for awhile now, her senses still keeping her apprised of the conversation and movement in the auditorium.  Her senses were well aware of the acrobatic woman with a tray of cupcakes before she even entered.  She found the woman’s high level of energy a bit off putting, but otherwise payed her little mind as she harassed the clique on the bleachers.<br><br>Her attention was drawn to the sound of a rather boisterous group of youths just before they entered the auditorium.  She looked up from her book and eyed them as they came in, at the same time her senses washing over the group.  The conversation was mostly meaningless to her, but several of them had interesting molecular vibrations.<br><br>The two young twins, both with curly red hair, were essentially opposites under the surface.  Aodhan, she had heard the boy called by his twin sister, had a faster than normal heart rate and his molecular vibrations in general seemed almost hyperactive compared to a normal human.  The other of the twins, the sister, had a very slow heart rate and her overall molecular vibrations seemed sluggish compared to a normal person.  She guessed this had something to do with whatever their abilities were, but from her observations alone she could not guess what.  However, she did notice that whenever the twins held hands their molecular vibrations seemed to balance out, almost as if they were somehow regulating each other.<br><br>She then moved on to observing the girl with white hair, maybe two years older than the twins she guessed and noticed something odd about the molecular vibrations of her circulatory system.  It seemed to have a higher level of vibration than the rest of her body, which Talia found very strange.  Harue, she had sensed her introduce herself as.<br><br>Yet another girl in the new group, around the same age as Harue, had very bizarre molecular brain vibrations.  There seemed one constant pattern, but it seemed to shift or ping into completely different patterns at rapid pace when she was whispering and giggling to herself, each pattern completely unique from the others, but always returned to the main pattern.  AJ and DJ she had heard when the girl whispered to herself, Jesse, she had heard the girl introduce herself as...but referred to herself as ‘we’.  Talia had known someone with multiple personality disorder back in Johannesburg City in South Africa and while this was similar there was something very strange about how the personalities shifted with this girl.<br><br>Talia finally moved on to observing the older woman that was with the children, maybe in her early twenties.  She could sense that there was something vaguely off with her molecular vibrations, but she couldn’t determine the meaning of it.<br><br>Just as she had finished her observations of the new group that walked in she could sense the acrobatic woman on the bleachers now heading in her direction.  <i>Wonder what she knows about me</i> she thought with a slight groan.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Ben nodded as Garth explained his only slightly insane reasoning for approaching the now-somehow-more-evil-looking teacher, and smirked at the girl's comments, Garth called her Almudena and he made a mental note to remember the name. It probably wasn't exactly how Garth might have pictured himself flying, he figured. As Garth's eyes flickered to the four students on the bleachers, so did his. He'd already clocked the pranks that had happened so far; each one had occurred right after the lilac-haired girl had said something. He was pretty sure it was that girl anyway, he wasn't exactly an expert on other powers, but based on how the other girl (the one in blue with dark hair) and the two boys (one skinnier in a red and white jacket, the other broad and muscled and wearing a leather vest) were reacting and celebrating the pranks while the lilac-haired girl smirked... Well, putting two and two together, he was pretty sure he'd got it right.<br><br>While he might not have been an expert, he wasn't exactly stupid either. Even before all this supernatural randomness was suddenly a <i>thing</i> in his life, he read a lot of fantasy and science fiction and all of those stories had their little quirks in their characters, how they'd use their powers. Magic wands and spells and incantations, or some pseudo-scientific glitch in genetics and all that. From what he'd learned about other powers after his own skill had manifested, a lot of it was the same as the books. He liked to keep an open mind with stuff like that.<br><br>"It doesn't sound that crazy," Ben offered, putting his hand on Garth's shoulder in what he hoped was a reassuring gesture. "I mean, that guy-" he nodded to the twenty-something year old in the suit "-can make drinks fly, Almudena's crazy strong, scary teacher man can apparently throw people across the room with wind... Supernatural whispering skills aren't really that unlikely."<br><br>Even so, he cast his eyes around the room again. Whispering to another student would probably be right up the clique's alley but what would be the point if they couldn't be certain how anyone would react? If Garth had just ignored them, he got the impression they would have tried something else to get a rise out of him, especially since he'd vocally expressed that he thought the prank war was a bad idea. Nah, probably not them. There were a couple of others, the girl who was still reading had still not tried to interact with anyone, could it have been her? Maybe that was how she was trying to talk to people? <i>Bit of a stretch,</i> he reasoned. The guy with the white hair, he'd seen him giving one of the younger kids a piece of candy so unless he was secretly a jerk, probably not him.<br><br><i>Kind of a dick move,</i> he thought to himself, giving Garth a quick once-over. He was looking less rattled but still a bit nervous now. <i>He's probably the most vulnerable looking guy here, those four at least targeted people who looked on their level.</i><br><br>"I wouldn't worry about it," he continued casually. "If someone was trying to prank you, I'm pretty sure they weren't expecting that to happen. They've probably had their fill."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SV</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Third grade," Mica said in similarly hushed tones.

I thought you might like this! It's carob and caramel!” Emily bumped the tray with her hip, popping a cupcake into the air. She caught it with her free hand, and rolled it onto the girl's desk.<br><br>The cupcake was frosted in blue and green, piped so that each stripe looked like feathers. It was decorated to resemble a parrotlike face, with bright red eyes boggling in wildly different directions.<br><br>“OOH!” Dalisay shucked the wrapper off, and instantly chomped down on the treat with vindictive satisfaction. Emily smiled faintly, and gave a small fist pump in triumph.<br><br>“Got it in one! Now, for the next...” Emily stooped over Mica's desk, twirling the tray around her waist and catching it behind her back.<br><br>“You're Mica, I bet! Your hair is so adorable!” Emily beamed. Ducking lower, she flipped the tray end over end, catching it in front. One cupcake had come loose, and plopped onto Mica's desk, unharmed and right-side up. It was frosted in brown, with what appeared to be grey rocks strewn across its surface.<br><br>“It's the cupcake's chocolate, except the rocks!” The baker twirled away. A moment later, she leaned back in, whispering in Mica's ear, “Okay, okay, the rocks are chocolate too!”<br><br>It was then that the twins caught her attention. Emily twirled about, using her foot to sweep the nearest empty desk between her and the twins. She plucked two cupcakes from the midst of the others, rolling the tray up her shoulder and balancing it on top of her head.<br><br>“Hello, Aodhan and-” Emily tilted her head, the tray pitching with the motion, “You're Eira!”<br><br>She dipped in the other direction, swaying the tray back to sitting level. The baker held up a cupcake in each hand, each with frosting swirled in a orange and blue tie-dye spiral.<br><br>“I wasn't sure which one of you would want which one, so I improvised! One's orange-cinnamon, and the other is orange-vanilla, like a creamsicle!” She deftly twisted both cupcakes, setting them spinning on edge as if they were tops. The sweets danced across the tabletop, colliding and bouncing off of eachother, but remaining firmly on the desk. Emily flourished with her hand, and then bounced her way over to the next student, still balancing the tray on top of her head like a confectionary Carmen Miranda.<br><br>“Harue!” Emily took the bewildered girl's hand and shook it enthusiasitically. “Actually, I've got two things for you!”<br><br>She brought her leg up, dipped her head, and dropped the tray, catching it on her knee.<br><br>“First, I've got this for you-” Emily took hold of the hem of her apron, and gave it a jerk. A wallet spurted out of its pouch, spinning end over end. The chef plucked it out of the air by its zipper, holding it steady as the wallet fell past her fingertips, unzipping it. Emily swung the wallet in an arc, the chubby beaded cardinal that bedecked it turning into a crimson blur. What appeared to be an asthma inhaler tumbled out, into Emily's waiting grasp. She twisted her wrist,  the wallet zipping itself and dropping into her apron-pouch in a single motion.<br><br>“Here!” Emily shoved it into Harue's palm. The inhaler was surprisingly heavy, almost falling before the girl had a chance to close her fingers.<br><br>“But I don't have-”<br><br>“It's not for asthma, though we <i>did</i> make it from an inhaler,” Emily grinned ear to ear and gave a cheerful thumbs up, “Natalie and I worked it out! It's a fire extinguisher!”<br><br>“It's not much of one, but it should be enough to handle any little spills that happen. And if that's not enough, we've got Flint and Kilik and Eira and Mister Silumas... Tho' I'm pretty sure Mister Silumas solves most problems by adding <i>more</i> blood and fire, so maybe try to find the other guys before asking him?” The baker put a finger to her lips in thought.<br><br>“Oh! And more importantly, I've got a cupcake for you!” Emily leaned forwards, and a cupcake that had somehow been balancing on top of her head fell into her hand. She proudly offered it to Harue, the rich brown of the chocolate cake contrasted by a perfectly white snowflake of whipped cream frosting across its top.<br><br>“It's dark chocolate, except for the filling. That's cherry-jalapeno preserves! Sweet on the outside, fiery heart-” Emily winked, before bounding away, “It's a surprisingly great combination!”<br><br>“Jesse! I can't wait to meet all of yous!”<br><br>The younger girl pursed her lips in thought, before realizing what Emily had meant.<br><br>“Oh, you mean-!”<br><br>The two put their hands over their mouths, and squealed in unison.<br><br> “I'm/You're going to be your/my dean!” They shouted at eachother.<br><br>“I made a cupcakes for you!” Emily reached into the tray, and began flicking miniature cupcakes into the air. They landed, one after another, until they formed a two-by-two square. The final one landed at the center, forming a pyramid of multicolored treats. The chef flicked her wrist, and a cherry instantly appeared, crowning the confection.<br><br>“There's a chocolate one, and a vanilla one, and strawberry one, and a coconut-chocolate one, and a mango one! That way, you can share one of each with yourselves!”<br><br>Emily frowned in thought.<br><br>“You should be able to have the ones you gave to your other yourselves here, as long as the other Emilies are just as clever as I am. And if they aren't, be sure to tell all the other Emilies to get their acts together!”<br><br>“It's tough being the best Emily, but somebody has to do it,” Emily put her arms akimbo and thrust her chest out proudly.<br><br>“Speaking of which, I've got many other days to brighten! I'll see you around! Emily, awaaay!” She grabbed the tray by its edge, and pivoted at her hip, hurling it across the room. It helicoptered over the heads of the seated students, whooshing disconcertingly loudly as it missed clipping them by scant inches. It hit the wall with a bang, bouncing off of the concrete. Emily hurdled over two of the desks in a single leap, hitting the floor in a roll.<br><br>She caught herself feetfirst, reversing her facing as she popped up and thrust her arm skywards. The tray smacked into the palm of her hand, having ricocheted to exactly where she stood.<br><br>“So... Ty?” Emily lowered the tray, beaming. She offered her free hand for an introductory shake. Her short, curvy, vibrant figure stood as a stark contrast to Ty's lanky, angular build an monochrome garb.<br><br>“You control vectors, right?” Nodding towards the tray, Emily continued, “I'm not a Power, but I've got a good eye for angles and trajectories, and it's helped me take care of myself for <i>years</i>. If you ever want help practicing your power, just let me know!”<br><br>Emily suddenly gasped, glancing over her shoulder. Thyra was watching her, arms crossed disapprovingly over her chest.<br><br>“Ah, of course, wearing proper protective eyewear and only in faculty approved locations, practicing with strictly nonlethal objects. And you'll need to get a signed liability waiver from your legal guardians in case of ensuing injury, maiming, death, or Acts of God,” Emily ticked off the items on her fingers. She glanced back towards the Superintendent, who gave her a hesitant nod.<br><br>“And I've got a cupcake for you!” Emily twirled one out of the tray and onto his desk, this one wobbling more noticably than the others had. As it came to rest, it became evident that this cake stood diagonally instead of straight-upwards, like somebody had stretched it to the side. Across the top was a grid of lines, warped in a subtle way that made the dome-shaped cake look flat across.<br><br>“It was tricky to do it, but I managed to make a cupcake that looked like your power was used on it! I couldn't think of a good flavor to go with it, so it's-” Emily shrugged, “It's a carrot cake. Everybody likes carrot cake!”<br><br>“And this is Talia!” Emily headed back towards one of the desks she'd hurdled, plucking out another treat. This one with topped with an unusually sparkly pink frosting, with a singular jagged black line piped around its outer edge.<br><br>“That line graphs the vibrations from me saying hello!” She noted proudly, and offered it to the younger woman, “At first I tried making a cupcake that vibrated, but-”<br><br>Emily's eyes went distant, and she shuddered.<br><br>“The less said about that, the better. There are some matters in which humanity was not meant to meddle.”<br><br>Under her breath, she murmured.<br><br>“Hopefully, it's not still on the loose...”<br><br>She shook her head, seemingly flinging away the memories like a dog shedding water.<br><br>“Instead, I worked pop-rocks into the frosting for this one. It's strawberry flavored! Enjoy!”<br><br>“Also, I'll be your dean. So if you ever need to talk to anybody about things, just let me know,” Emily's manic energy faded, subsumed by her sympathetic tone. She put a hand on Taylor's shoulder, “I'll understand.”<br><br>Giving a single nod of acknowledgment, she turned away from the girl, and was on her way.<br><br>“Andre!” Emily flopped into the desk next to Deandre, “Awww... I was hoping that our really tall student was going to be the one named Andre, but this is okay too. We can still quote The Princess Bride together, right?”<br><br>“I don't actually know much of anything at all about you,” Emily noted blithely, “The file we had on you had all sorts of bits and pieces rearranged and missing.”<br><br>“I didn't know what to do for you, so I just did this-” Emily produced a chocolate frosted cupcake, with a vanilla looking cake portion. “It's got a custard filling, like a Boston Cream Pie.” <br><br>She offered it to him, and then glanced around rapidly, as if paranoid.<br><br>“Now, don't tell anybody about this, because I'm guessing this is top secret...” Her tone got deadly serious, “I know what the 'redacted' information in you file was, and why the faculty purged it. I'm not going to make any trouble for you, I promise. Just be honest with me...”<br><br>“They redacted your favorite kind of cupcake, didn't they?”<br>-----<br>Dalisay nodded towards Mica, her mouth still too full of cupcake to actually verbally respond.<br><br>She paused, and sipped chocolate milk, washing the cake down.<br><br>"I don't know if I should feel good or bad about this," The young girl pondered, "I think she's actually going to <i>like</i> the Scamps."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5248172').toggle();if($('#spoiler5248172').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5248172"><i>Crappy ol' post.

He shifted in his seat and tried to make a smile that could match hers. When that didn't seem to be working, he took a bite of the cupcake which helped, of course. He remembered when a Boston cream doughnut and an Aerosmith best-of had been the only things getting him through a bitter winter morning commute when the parkway had stretched on single-lane for what felt like thirty miles and the snowflakes had been coming down so thick that the taillights ahead had been the only thing pointing him forward, and no that <i>wasn't</i> his but he did have it written down already. He wiped a bit of frosting off his lips from the first bite and grinned at her.<br><br>"Thank you so much, ma'am, it's delicious," came his Georgian drawl. "As far as me, there's not very much to tell, I guess. But we'll all get to know each other over the year, I'm sure."<br><br>What was redacted in his file? He didn't think she was joking about that - Miss Shwartzwald had obviously gone to a lot of trouble researching the students beforehand. Was it the description of his power? But why wouldn't the faculty know everyone's powers? Well, all right, Miss Shwartzwald was staff, not faculty. But how did that make a difference? Deandre glanced at the other adults congregating on the stage - the woman whom he recognized as Miss Russell from the acceptance packet. Was he wrong to assume that everyone up there knew his power? If CANDIDATE NUMBER ONE didn't already know his power, what could happen when he found out? Would Deandre be sent packing that afternoon?<br><br>No. That was stupid. He wasn't going to worry about that. He contented himself by quickly adding a line underneath Miss Shwartzwald's entry.<br><br>EMILY <s>SHWORTSWALD</s> - CHEF/GIRLS DEAN - CUPCAKES - V/ENERG<br>SHWARTZWALD?<br>ACROBATIC - BALANCE?

As for the jagged line around the cupcake being the graph of the woman saying hello she couldn’t be sure given that her senses didn’t produce graphs for her, but still, it was a nice touch.<br><br>She also found the line hinting at the creation of a vibrating and possibly living, mutant cupcake slightly amusing and gave a slight smile.  While her energy level was a bit much, the woman seemed pleasant none the less and so she was pleased to know that she would be the dean for the female dorms.<br><br>As the woman bounded off again Talia picked up her cupcake and peeled off the paper as she eyed it and washed her senses over it.  Pink wasn’t exactly a color she liked, but she loved strawberry and pop-rocks had been a personal favorite of hers when she was a kid.  She shut her eyes as she took a bite, savoring the flavor and the sensation of the pop-rocks popping in her mouth.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Crazy strong?” Almudena scoffed, “Amigo, un halago desabrido es peor que un insulto.”<br><br>“Yeah, I mean, if I hear a voice ask me about the beehive outside the boy's dorm, I don't think my first reaction this time is going to be walking over and slapping it,” Garth chuckled, “I think I've kinda had my fill, too.”<br><br>“I don't think I'm good yet. Nobody's gotten banished to their room, suspended, or expelled, so we're really underperforming by my standards,” Almudena shrugged, “Por supuesto, getting slam-dunked by a teacher might actually outdo any of those, sooo...”<br><br>Garth turned to the newcomer, a shorter boy with even paler skin and hair than his own, but with a significantly more athletic build. His eyes widened.<br><br>“Does the really loud lady... uh, happen to know you, by any chance? She's-”<br><br>“Flint!” Emily tackle-hugged the criomancer from behind, somehow bowling him into a backflip. They somersaulted over the bewildered Garth, landing on the hard wood floor with a loud thunk.<br><br>“Ah, she's coming this way,” Garth finished.<br><br>“It's been so long since I've seen you! I'm so happy you chose to come to school here! And Belwyn's here too! Do you think Didn't will show up next?” Emily paused, and sat up. She put a hand up, the tray landing on her palm with a clank.<br><br>“I made your cupcake extra special for you! It's got icecream in the center!” Emily cast her gaze skyward. High above them, a loose cupcake plummeted. She tumbled out of the way, letting it fall onto the Flint's chest, miraculously unmarred.<br><br>It was frosted in white, an azure design airbrushed across it. Cerulean rock candy was arrayed in a circle across the top, looking like miniature glaciers.<br><br>“It's blue raspberry!  And the filling is black raspberry icecream!” Emily wrinkled her nose in thought, “Wait, why is it that there's black and blue raspberries, anyways? Does somebody beat up the raspberries before they put them into food?”<br><br>“Could you imagine having that job?” Emily straightened her shoulders and jutted out her chin, and spoke in the deepest drawl she could manage, “Yup, mah name's Hank. Ah work with raspberries. No, Ah don't pick 'em, Ah punch 'em. Yeah, that's right, Ah'm tha guy who pummels 'em before they end up on yer table.”<br><br>“And suddenly, I've found my calling in life,” Almudena mused.<br><br>“But anyways!” Emily did a roundoff over Flint. The motion completed upended her tray, but Emily twisted, using centrifugal force to pin the cakes in place. The moment she'd landed, Almudena was at her side, hand out expectantly.<br><br>“Cupcake for me?”<br><br>“Nope!” Emily retorted. The younger girl furrowed her brow.<br><br>“Seriously?”<br><br>“Scout's honor!” The chef put her hand over her heart, “But that'd be unfair-”<br><br>“No jodas.”<br><br>“So I brought you two half cupcakes!” Emily produced a two-toned confection. The inside was a rich tan, while the outside was an almost translucent ring of white.<br><br>“I couldn't make the outer cupcake transparent like your powers, but I tried! It's angelfood cake with a toasted coconut frosting, and the middle is vanilla with a dulce de leche filling.”<br><br>“That's perfect!” Almudena snatched it out of Emily's grasp, and chomped into it. As soon as the treat hit her tongue, she let out a blissful sigh.<br><br>“Wait-” She spoke with her mouth still half-full, spraying crumbs, “Last night I talked with my friends back home, and I told them I was missing the desserts from bakery at the corner... Were you eavesdropping?”<br><br>“Don't be silly, Alma!” Emily stepped past her, to Garth and Ben, “I'm the dean! Technically, nothing I do counts as eavesdropping!”<br><br>Almudena paused in thought, chewing slowly. She raised a finger as if to object, then shrugged, and took another huge bite.<br><br>“Garth! How was your summer job?”<br><br>The youth nervously glanced over to Ben, and then back to Almudena, before he answered.<br><br>“Ah, it was...” Garth licked his lips, “You know, temp jobs. It really kicked my butt.”<br><br>“Next time you see Nopnop, tell him I said hi!”<br><br>“He'll be thrilled. For once I'm forwarding something besides death threats to him,” Garth sighed, rolling his eyes, “I've had Natalie call me four times now, each time because she'd come up with some creative way to tell Nopcsa she was going to brutalize and-slash-or murder him and wanted me to pass the word along. If it was <i>anybody</i> else, I'd wonder what he'd done to earn her ire, but you know...”<br><br>“Natalie,” Emily concluded.<br><br>“Nopcsa,” Garth agreed.<br><br>“Cupcake!” Emily retorted, flinging a cupcake at the boy's face.<br><br>“Cripes!” Garth swiped his hand through the air, a contrail of iridescent flames roiling in his wake. The burst deflected the cupcake, sending it tumbling away. Emily caught it on the rebound. She offered it to him, less violently than the first time.<br><br>The slightly singed frosting was decorated with a tie-dye pattern, each color of the rainbow represented. From the look of the cupcake, it was composed of seven different layers, each a different hue.<br><br>“Your powers are so colorful that I just had to try to encapsulate it in a cupcake!” Emily's expression went serious for a moment, “Not literally, because it would explode, but I did a flavor for each color of fire you use!"<br><br>"Red is dragonfruit, orange is mango and not orange because that’d be cliche, yellow is pineapple, green is carambola, blue is acai, purple is passionfruit, and the violet is concord grape!"<br><br>"Uh, thank you, Emily," Garth tilted his head, attempting to comprehend exactly how he was supposed to approach eating it.<br><br>"Oh, I almost forgot!" Emily flicked her wrist, and a multicolored candle appeared directly in the middle of Garth's cupcake. She started to reach for a lighter, and then reconsidered.<br><br>"Could you?"<br><br>Garth nodded, and snapped his fingers. A green spark shot to the wick, and set it alight. The flame crackled softly, scintillating and shifting through a spectrum of hues.<br><br>"Enjoy!" She whirled twords Ben, quickdrawing another cupcake. In one smooth motion, she had put the cupcake in his left hand and started shaking his right.  <br><br>"Hello Ben! As you already know, I'm Emily. If you were a girl, I'd be our dean, but you're not, so I'll just be the chef!" Emily vigorously shook his whole arm, with no real rhythm to the motion.<br><br>"I made you a peanut butter cupcake! I wanted to use chocolate, but then I realized that would probably kill you so I had to go with just peanut  butter-" Emily noticed his expression, a cross between gamely amused and incredibly  baffled.<br><br>"Ah, I might have misread your file... You don't actually shapeshift into a dog, do you?" Emily finally broke the handshake, "Uh, well, enjoy the cupcake!"<br><br>Emily sprinted away, hurdling up onto the stage. She landed next to Silumas, and approached him with a cupcake.<br><br>"Oh, dear Lord... I think we just got the Girl's Dean killed," Garth mulled, watching as she shoved a cupcake into the elementalist's hands.<br>------<br>“Hello Mister Silumas! I’m so glad I’m getting to work with you!” Emily beamed, carefully avoiding touching the chair that Garth had been sitting in before the mage blasted him across the gym.<br><br>The cupcake she’d offered him was frosted black, with a rich brown cake underneath. The top was decorated with a ring of skulls, painstakingly carved out of large marshmallows. Each one had a mysterious hole piercing through the top of their cranium.<br><br>“It’s devil’s food cake, of course. The frosting incorporates a strong rum note, which I think will go well with the chocolate, and the-“ Emily gestured for the elementalist to hold out the cupcake.  She produced a match, striking it against the zipper of her wallet, and touched it to the frosting.<br><br>Tongues of blue fire erupted across its surface, dancing ephemerally. As the flames touched the skulls, each one went up in moments. The blaze drew air through the chimney carved into them, producing a noise like the blackened, smoldering skulls were screaming.<br><br>“You can put out the flame, or eat it as is. It’s a sophisticated cupcake, but from what I hear, you’re a sophisticated teacher, so it should work out okay!” Emily gave one last polite bow, and turned away from him.<br><br>“THAT’S IT FOR CUPCAKES! ANY FACULTY AND STUDENTS WHO HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THEIRS WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE POWER DEMONSTRATIONS! IF ANYBODY COMPLAINS, I’D SAY TOUGH COOKIES, BUT THE COOKIES I MAKE ARE ALWAYS SOFT AND DELICIOUS!”<br><br>With her voice echoing, Emily hopped off the stage, and ambled over to Thyra. The superintendent had an eyebrow raised quite high on her substantial forehead.<br><br>“I know, I know…” Emily set her tray on the refreshments table, “I went out of order. But would <i>you</i> tell Silumas that he had to wait for his cupcake?”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Silumas</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">The Elementalist observed the annoyingly energetic woman prance about the auditorium giving away her baked goods.  Silumas' eyes narrowed in irritation as she pronounced this small confection this, and that tiny cake that.  His patience had about worn out waiting for Thyra to continue with the proceedings when Emily bounded up to him.<br><br><br>Then, most surprisingly, she treated him with what appeared to be a great amount of respect. It was a surprise in as much the only person to give him any respect at all was Zebedee, and that was because Zebedee had seen what Silumas was truly capable of, all those years ago. Thyra was respectful, on the surface at least, but Silumas felt as much fear, disdain, and at times disgust from the woman. Yet, here Emily was kind, but most importantly, respectful. <br><br><br>She held out a cupcake for him to take, and with a curious frown, he accepted it. During her description of his gift he watched her more than treat. Even with the sapphire flames dancing across the icing he watched Emily, with deep intrigue. She obviously knew who he was, what he had done, if not entirely certain what he was capable of doing. Still, she dared to be kind to him. She had no remarkable Powers that Silumas could find immediately, no magic or superpower that made her beyond human. Her acrobatics aside, she seemed like a perfectly normal human being. Still, Emily stood near the god-like being that Silumas was as an equal.<br><br><br>"...from what I hear, you're a sophisticated teacher..." she said at one point, snapping him out of his curious dive into Emily's motives, her potential. Again, kindness. She could have called him a bully, an aggressor, an evil man somehow graced with the position of teaching the older children, and she would have been mostly right. Instead, she called him sophisticated. She seemed unafraid, undaunted by his presence the way most others were, so she had not spoken out of a survival instinct. There was simply one conclusion that Silumas could come to: respect.<br><br><br>Emily respected Silumas, for the being that he was: powerful beyond recognition, yet still here to teach. Here to help these children make something of themselves. Silumas, like Emily, volunteered for this position, and thus they were comrades. <br><br><br>They were comrades.<br><br><br><i>This is new... <br></i><br><br>Silumas was always top of the food chain, king of the castle, top dog. Never was he a comrade. He was part of a team now, which was entirely strange. He had worked with fellow Magi before, temporarily of course, but it was always a tense partnership that just as often ended in bloodshed. This, this was different. Several powerful individuals were devoted to running this school, to teaching these children. They were a team devoted to the same goal. Silumas was on that team. He was a part of that team. <br><br><br>The cupcake. Silumas returned his attention to the now, to the sweet in his palm. An incredibly complex usage of Water helped him quickly separate the cupcake into six equal parts in his hand and he watched the flames for a few moments. The ephemeral flames were interesting to watch, though mundane. How she had caused her confection to do this was a mystery to Silumas, and that was part of what made it interesting, but more so that she had tried to make it fit her knowledge of him. She had attempted to personalize the cupcake for Silumas. The screaming skulls were an interesting choice, and it actually evoked an audible, but quiet guffaw from him for a moment. With a quick flick with a finger, and a bit of Air, a piece of the cupcake flew from his palm to his mouth. <br><br><br>The taste was savory and sweet. Unfortunately for Silumas, he did not really have any past experiences with which to compare this one. Tastes were never something he had focused on, it had always just been about nutrition. But this, this was something completely different. Its nutritional value was abysmal, but by the Planes it was delicious. Sweetness set off just right against the punch of the rum flavored icing. The marshmallow skulls, burnt as they were, added a savory tang to the rainbow of flavors.  Piece after piece Silumas finished it.<br><br><br>When he had finished, he smiled, a genuine smile which was rare, and stood. Slowly he walked from the stage to the gathering of the rest of the faculty. It was hard to tell if he was truly walking or floating, his graceful movements and bulky robes either disguising his movement or his powers helping him to levitate. <br><br><br>For each in the group Silumas gave the slightest of inclinations of his chin, a bare nod and recognition of their place on the team of teachers and administrators. His silent introduction continued for a couple of moments before he finally came eye to eye with Emily, his nod noticeably deeper.<br> <br><br>"Your gift was quite delicious, Mistress Emily, and I thank you for it. I will," Silumas smiled ever so slightly but it warmed his face tremendously, "repay it at the first opportunity. And 'tough cookies' is an interesting phrase, I would very much like an explanation of where it comes from some time."<br><br><br>The warmth and smile vanished as quickly as it came as he turned to Thyra, "Head Mistress, might I suggest we move things along?"<br><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">The room seemed to spin as the air was forced from Flint’s lungs. Time seemed to slow as everything flipped upside down; razor sharp ice began to form on his fingertips, ready to skewer whatever abnormality had caused this unexpected occurrence. Reflexes sent his arm flashing through the air in a blur, straight toward any vital point it could find. This motion sent his body into rotation. As he rotated Emily’s familiar face entered his field of vision. As he recognized her, Flint stopped his hand and retracted it back to his side; three tiny holes could barely be seen in her t-shirt between the sixth and seventh ribs. Her smile was still irking and beautiful and her eyes were still annoying and full of joy.  He wasn’t sure if she hadn’t noticed that he almost punctured one of her lunges or if she just didn’t care. Either way she seemed unphased.  The ceiling seemed to be getting further and further away as Flint braced himself for the uncomfortable landing to come. Exhaling before impact, Flint let out a small grunt as his body slammed into the floor.  The sound of flesh impacting floorboards rung in his ears as Emily peered down at him rambling on about some cupcake that had just landed on his chest. “I am going to shoot this woman.” He groaned.  <br><br>Emily saw another student and ran off to distribute the remainder of her cupcakes. Flint remained on his back and tilted his head backward as he watched her joyfully tumble around the gymnasium. He had never met anyone who annoyed him as much as she did. Raising his hand above his head, Flint made a fist and extended his thumb and index finger. Lazily lowering his arm behind him Flint began to follow Emily with his finger. With his other hand he grabbed the cupcake and took the first small bite. Raspberry flavors gently caressed his tongue; the ice cream had begun to melt into the outer layer of cupcake causing the confectionery treat to be soft and fluffy on the outside, and heavy and moist on the inside. Small pieces of rock candy crunched between his teeth breaking up the uniform consistency of the cupcake. Pulling his free arm back to his side, Flint took another bite.  “Maybe she doesn’t have to die today.” He thought as he continued to watch her parade through the students. <br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Oh, thank you!" Emily lowered her head and blushed at the complement, "And no, um, it's just <i>Miss</i> Emily, for now."<br><br>She raised her hand, and wiggled her bare ring finger.<br><br>"Don't worry about repaying me! We're all a team, here- This is just what we do," Emily beamed.<br><br>A moment later, she furrowed her brow.<br><br>"Honestly, I have no idea where 'tough cookies' comes from," The chef cupped a hand over her mouth, and concluded in a conspiratorial stage whisper, "That must mean it's the other bakers that make them! Right, Thyra?" Emily elbowed the superintendent lightly in the ribs, trying to get her attention.<br><br>"Ha. Ha. Yes, Emily," Thyra deadpanned, lowering her sunglasses. She turned to face Silumas.<br><br>"We'll be moving things along shortly, once everybody finishes their snacks," Thyra nodded politely, and walked past him, starting to ascend the stairs of the stage.<br><br>"You have to understand, Mr. Silumas, that properly maintaining the attention of children is a very delicate balance. If we didn't feed them before this, they'd be hungry. If we try to start too soon, they'll still be busy eating. And if we take too long, and let them settle, they'll be napping off a sugar crash before we're ready. When it comes to dealing with adolescents, it takes properly orchestrating everything so that they're optimally situated to learn. More than anything, that is our burden. Learning is their choice, whereas our duty is simply removing as many obstructions as we can, and allowing them to flourish."<br><br>As Thyra reached the stage, she turned her head away from the others, and allowed herself a slight grimace. Projecting confidence and dignity was the best possible thing she could do for the school, but at this point in her life, she scarcely felt adequate for her burden. Here she was, barely six years older than some of her students, and yet everybody was expecting her to rise to the occasion and lead what was quite possibly the most daunting educational program imaginable.<br><br>She smoothed her skirt and took the seat nearest the podium, exhaling deeply.<br><br>"God doesn't call the qualified, he qualifies the called," She murmured faintly to herself.<br><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Jesse beamed back at Dalisay.  She seemed to be a sweet girl from what she'd gleaned from the others.  Maybe a little trouble prone, but sweet. <br><br>“You're Dallas, right?” Emily's voice rang out across the classroom. Jesse reflexively put her hands up over her head as if to catch something, but they only met air. She brought her hands back down for inspection then shrugged it off with a “Huh,”. She wasn't extremely surprised. It happened from time to time. Her smile began to grow again as Miss Emily jumped from person to person handing out her personalized confections. <br><br>Eira peeked out from behind her hand at the screeching sound as the empty desk came to rest between them and this Emily woman. She couldn't help the giggle that escaped at the sight of balancing treats on the brunette's head.  Maybe her brother was right. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad here.  Still, she held his hand a little tighter at being directly addressed. <br><br>The odd vibe left in the room from some previous event was noted, but as far as Aodhan was concerned this was one of the best days ever.  Meeting new people, learning new things, sweets they didn't have to nick, and they weren't those store made things either.  These were gourmet quality and presentation! <br><br>The twins caught their cupcakes as they bounced off each other, responding with a simultaneous “Thanks!”.  With a glace at each other, it was decided to trade their prizes. Steam rose from the orange cinnamon cake as Aodhan handed it over to his sister and small ice crystals formed in the frosting on top of the orange vanilla as Eira handed her's to him.  Taking their seats, they both leaned back, contently nibbling as the scene continued to unfold. <br><br>A nervous smile made it's way to Harue's face as her whole body seemed to move with the enthusiasm of the handshake.  What was she getting herself into? Maybe it wasn't too late for her to transfer to that public school in the United States? At least there she would know half of what was going on.  After Miss Emily's show of acrobatics, Harue found herself inspecting a surprisingly weighty inhaler that had been shoved into her palm quite suddenly. <br><br>“But I don't have-” She started, but was cut off by the woman.<br><br>“It's not for asthma, though we did make it from an inhaler,” Emily grinned ear to ear and gave a cheerful thumbs up, “Natalie and I worked it out! It's a fire extinguisher!” <br><br>“Oh...” Harue smiled, but rubbed the back of her neck in embarrassment.<br><br>“It's not much of one, but it should be enough to handle any little spills that happen. And if that's not enough, we've got Flint and Kilik and Eira and Mister Silumas... Tho' I'm pretty sure Mister Silumas solves most problems by adding more blood and fire, so maybe try to find the other guys before asking him?” The baker put a finger to her lips in thought. <br><br>“Sure?” Harue's reply was uncertain.  Was Mister Silumas someone else who worked there? He didn't exactly sound like someone you wanted to have in a school. But then again, that was the whole point of this school wasn't it?<br><br>“Oh! And more importantly, I've got a cupcake for you!” Emily leaned forwards, and a cupcake that had somehow been balancing on top of her head fell into her hand. She proudly offered it to Harue, the rich brown of the chocolate cake contrasted by a perfectly white snowflake of whipped cream frosting across its top.<br><br>“It's dark chocolate, except for the filling. That's cherry-jalapeno preserves! Sweet on the outside, fiery heart-” Emily winked, before bounding away, “It's a surprisingly great combination!” <br><br>Harue was touch by the metaphor in the cupcake and picked it up gently as to not smear the frosting. <br><br>“Arigato gazaimasu.” She said with a light smile before Emily jumped on to Jesse. <br><br>“Jesse! I can't wait to meet all of yous!”<br><br>The younger girl pursed her lips in thought, before realizing which Emily this probably was.<br><br>“Oh, you mean-!”<br><br>The two put their hands over their mouths, and squealed in unison.<br><br>“I'm/You're going to be your/my dean!” They shouted at each other. Oh this was going to be so much fun! The late night talks, the sneaking into the kitchen for late night baking.  It was going to be a good year.<br><br>“I made a cupcakes for you!” Emily reached into the tray, and began flicking miniature cupcakes into the air. Jesse was enthralled with how they landed, one after another, until they formed a two-by-two square. The final one landed at the center, forming a pyramid of multicolored treats. The chef flicked her wrist, and a cherry instantly appeared, crowning the confection. Jesse applaud for the woman.<br><br>“There's a chocolate one, and a vanilla one, and strawberry one, and a coconut-chocolate one, and a mango one! That way, you can share one of each with yourselves!”<br><br>Emily frowned in thought.<br><br>“You should be able to have the ones you gave to your other yourselves here, as long as the other Emilies are just as clever as I am. And if they aren't, be sure to tell all the other Emilies to get their acts together!”<br><br>Jesse nodded emphatically. <br><br>“It's tough being the best Emily, but somebody has to do it,” Emily put her arms akimbo and thrust her chest out proudly.<br><br>“Speaking of which, I've got many other days to brighten! I'll see you around! Emily, awaaay!” She grabbed the tray by its edge, and pivoted at her hip, hurling it across the room. <br><br>Jesse was all but bouncing in her seat with excitement.  An Emily that baked was a good Emily! At least usually... If nothing else, movie nights and holidays were amazing. <br><br>~*~<br><br>Belwyn gave up keeping track of Emily's movements once she left the middle school group and instead took to studying the room more as a whole. <br><br>Powers aside, things appeared normal. Or as normal as she knew anyway, which come to think of it wasn't that average. The skid marks and broken paneling of the floor did raise some questions. Clearly she and her charges had just missed something judging from the small group that was forming around one of the paler boys. She was sure she would find out what happened sooner or later. This was a school after all. There were very few things that stayed unknown there.<br><br>Next her eyes caught sight of Thyra who was, in fact, keeping track of Emily. How, however, was a mystery to her.  Belwyn absently ran her hands over her white sundress, smoothing down the colorfully embroidered flowers. This was her first official job and I meant allot to her to have something consistent in her life like this.  She certainly didn't want to mess this up.  Thyra glanced her way and Belwyn gave her a friendly wave. <br><br>Other teachers and staff were slowly filing in to take their seats on the stage, so Belwyn figured she ought to do the same. To her credit, she made it half way there before having to sidestep to avoid being crushed by Emily and a very upset Flint. Thankfully there had been the warning of “Flint!” before the tumbling duo fell from the air.    <br><br>“It's been so long since I've seen you! I'm so happy you chose to come to school here! And Belwyn's here too! Do you think Didn't will show up next?” Emily said before suddenly sitting up.  Belwyn gave a sheepish wave in greeting and backed up a few more steps. The brunette went on explaining the special cupcake she had made for the white haired boy who was becoming increasingly more irritated as it went on.  Especially the part about the the berry's coloration. But true to herself, like a flash Emily was off again. Belwyn saw Flint aim his finger at her and rolled her eyes.  After a bite of his cupcake she saw his resolve lessen.<br><br>“Maybe she doesn’t have to die today.” He muttered. Belwyn extended her hand to help him up. <br><br>“Lets not start with that again.” There was amusement in her voice, but a serious note lingered in the background. <br><br>“THAT’S IT FOR CUPCAKES! ANY FACULTY AND STUDENTS WHO HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THEIRS WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE POWER DEMONSTRATIONS! IF ANYBODY COMPLAINS, I’D SAY TOUGH COOKIES, BUT THE COOKIES I MAKE ARE ALWAYS SOFT AND DELICIOUS!” Belwyn winced and plugged one ear with her palm.<br><br>“I think that's my cue. We'll talk later.” She gave Flint a friendly pat on the back and hurried off to her peers. </div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"No era mi intención ofenderte," Ben replied, though he was pretty sure he was getting the pronunciation way off. Whether Almudena heard him or not became less of a concern because, at that moment, the extremely... <i>vibrant</i> woman took the opportunity to flip not only herself, but the quiet kid too over their heads. The kid looked... actually, the kid looked completely unperturbed. Hell, he looked more put-out than shell-shocked. However, he didn't have much time to think about that because she was heading their way now.<br><br>He can't honestly say he was surprised by Almudena back-chatting to a faculty member, nor by Emily's unabashed declaration of eavesdropping, if he's being honest. Even though he'd seen her undeniably impressive feats of acrobatics with the crew on the bleachers (and laughed at their reactions, the girls had looked like they were holding bombs for God's sake), having her move in their space was a bit different. More than once, he thought one of the cupcakes was definitely about to fly off the tray and hit some unsuspecting student in the face. Not that that would be a bad thing, really, since there was still some tension in the room that Emily hadn't quite managed to shatter. <br><br>Garth and Emily were talking now, all-too-familiar and casual for them not to know each other. There was a brief flicker from Garth, just a quick glance that told Ben that the other guy didn't really want to talk about it. Or, at least, not in front of people he barely knew. He caught names, Natalie and... Nopnop? And he hoped they were just joking about the death threats though, with how bizarre Emily was, he couldn't completely be sure they weren't. There was a flash when Emily threw the cupcake and Ben just about had time to register a blur of colours, a rainbow of flames that batted the confectionery away. He was kind of surprised, when Emily handed it over like a normal person, that it hadn't been completely squashed when she caught it again. <br><br><i>That's... pretty,</i> he thought to himself as Garth lit the candle and the flame flickered across the spectrum. Rainbow flames. Huh. If he'd had to guess Garth's powers before, he probably wouldn't have said the power of razzle-dazzle but now that he was thinking about it, it made some sense. It was bright and flashy, not the sort of thing that could be ignored, and hadn't Garth said something about not knowing whether someone was a Power when causing trouble? It was like a big warning label, "I Have Powers, Consider That When Attacking Me", and he definitely wasn't psycho-analyzing some guy he'd just met. No sir. Still, he didn't really expect that he'd come across a pretty power when he got out of bed that morning.<br><br>And now it was his turn. Emily had already managed to grab his hand before she'd even opened his mouth and the handshake would have made his whole body shake along with it if he hadn't started compensating against it. Not that he minded, he liked enthusiastic people. They tended to try harder and he liked it when he saw passion driving people, instead of the usual daily grind kind of drive. She was saying something about a chocolate cupcake and must have noticed his nonplussed expression because if there was a link between chocolate and his death, he couldn't make it. It wasn't until she mentioned dogs that it clicked in his head, and okay, he'd never considered that before. He actually couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten something while in beast mode. Maybe never?<br><br>The cupcake was delicious. The texture was soft and fluffy, not over- or under-cooked, and there was a saltiness that the peanut butter added to the otherwise sweet taste. It wasn't something he would have chosen, peanut butter was always hit or miss with him, but there was no denying that this particular combination of flavours was a winner. He took another bite as he watched Emily approach the intimidating teacher on the stage, nodding at Garth's comment in agreement.<br><br><i>I should know their names by now... Sil- something?</i> Ben thought to himself as the teacher descended from the stage and approached the other members of faculty. He hadn't thrown Emily across the room like he had with Garth and Ben was pretty sure he'd seen something resembling a smile on the now-bald man's face. And sure, the smile looked genuine enough but it didn't make the guy look any less threatening.<br><br>"Check it out, she's not dead," he offered.<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Kilik swiped across his phone screen as he said, "It doesn't look like the internet knows where that expression came from. If I had to guess, it probably started with someone who wasn't great a baking. I'm pretty sure the human race wasn't born with some inherited knowledge of what the phrase 'tough cookies' means." <br><br>He slipped his phone back into his pockets and watched Thyra ascend the stage. Something about what she was saying wasn't quite clicking for him. It was almost clinical, a bit like she'd read the theory and was reciting it from, like, How To Teach 101. Maybe a self-help book. It wasn't quite professional, even though Thyra was exuding that easily enough, he was reminded of a person trying to explain something simple to a child. Was that it? Silumas clearly didn't have the same grasp of understanding the world that the average person had. He turned his gaze to the other teacher.<br><br>Silumas didn't make him nervous, exactly. Wary would be a better word. He might have missed whatever had happened between the teacher and Garth but there were still eyes among the students that were flickering back to him. It might have just been his appearance for the kids, robes weren't exactly the wisest fashion choice Kilik had ever seen, but standing this close told him pretty much everything he needed to know. Silumas was strong. It was the sort of strength that kept Kilik on his toes. When people were that strong, accidents tended to happen.<br><br>Putting it from his mind for now, he followed Thyra up the stage, clapping her shoulder as he passed before taking a seat.<br><br><br> </div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Next time, I'll be sure to placate him with cupcakes before I try to storm the stage," Garth murmured, shaking his head incredulously.<br><br>"If I chuck you across the room, will you give me cupcakes too?" Almudena offered. She took a bite out of the center of the one Emily had given her, and visibly shuddered in pleasure, "Say what you will, but the woman can cook."<br><br><b>CLOP CLOP CLOP</b><br><br>The sound of boots echoed from the hallway.<br><br>Garth sighed loudly, and rolled his eyes to indicate Silumas to Ben and Alma.<br><br>"Welp, here comes another one."<br><br>The doors swung open, and a wiry adolescent girl sauntered through. She wore a hand sewn gingham dress past her knees in blue and white, with heeled cowboy boots that covered the rest of her legs. Her hair swung in two long pigtails, the colors of fresh cornsilk.  Despite her thin frame, it was evident she had formidable muscles, presumably honed through years of rigorous farmwork.<br><br>"Si, furball. Looks like a real dangerous type, there," Almudena elbowed Garth in the ribs, taking care to do so lightly.<br><br>The new girl clomped over to the snack table, and noted with dismay that all the donuts and cups for drinks were already gone.<br><br>With a resigned shrug, she scooped up the half full gallon jug of cider, and took it with her as she headed to her seat.<br><br>"Achis!" Almudena's jaw dropped.<br><br>"Come again?"<br><br>"'I don't believe it'," Almudena sighed, "I should have thought of that first!"<br><br>"Naturally."<br>------<br>The farmgirl galloped over to where Dalisay and Mica were seated, and flopped into a seat on the other side of the Filippina.<br><br>"Howdy!" The lass clearly had no indoor voice, but it seemed fully possible that she <i>had</i> been raised in a barn. She sat up and offered a hand in greeting, the jug sloshing in her other, "Ah'm Emma Ray Jo McCrowley, but y'all kin jes' call me Emma Ray Jo!"<br><br>"Dalis-" Dalisay looked pensively towards Almudena, who was currently inhaling the last of her treat from Emily, "Just Dallas. Salazar."<br><br>"Charmed," Emma Ray beamed, freckles across her nose wrinkling. She took the girl's diminutive hand in her own calloused mitt, and shook carefully.<br><br>She glanced over at where Emily stood.<br><br>"Aw, shucks.

The sentiment was greatly appreciated, the offer for help learning to use his powers better was much to kind, but the sheer shock left him slack-jawed and speechless.  The cupcake Emily had toppled onto his desk made his eyes hurt but it seemed to be pretty true to form for this powers as he understood them.  Ty didn't fully grasp the depth of his abilities or to what extent he could use them but Emily's ability to translate them into a confectionery form was beyond impressive.  Ty awkwardly ripped the wrapping from his cake and sat it aside before taking a bite.  <br><br>"Here goes..."<br><br>The almost too sweet cream cheese icing hit his tongue first like a sugary missile before the multiple layers of moist, mildly spiced cake cut in a memory of ones grandmother, welcoming and warm.  Ty's mind shut down for a moment and  allowed the flavors to play in his mouth for a long moment before swallowing and taking another bite.  After a few moments the sweet treat was gone and Ty was left wanting more.  The thought struck him that if he requested a private session for help with his powers and potentially petition for another cupcake.<br><br><i>This could work.</i><br><br>~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Marius regarded the other staff around him with stern eyes.  Valon hadn't mentioned the other staff members would be such a mixed bag, let alone one that contained such a colorful personality to contend with.  Marius had it in his head that the staffers at this school would be by the book and strict, but it seemed that was a bit off target to expect.  The robed man known as Silumas radiated rage and death like a beacon of hate, but seemed to have a soft spot of some description.  The other man Marius hand not heard the name of, nor could he get a proper impression of.  Thyra was spoken of well by his master and as such had already earned Marius' respect and trust.  Emily had gotten under his skin in a way she should not have.  it appeared that she thrived on being in the crowd, the social interaction of large groups that made Marius want to run away.  She was far more upbeat than Marius cared for and seemed to Marius to be everything that he wasn't.<br><br><i>This one shall be my greatest challenge here.  The students won't test me as much as Emily will.  Aou'n, give me strength.</i><br><br>Marius slipped out of the gathering and began up towards the stage with smooth, measured strides.  He glided up the steps and slipped up to the massive window to gather his thoughts.  The view of the sea reminded him of home in Drakengrad.  The sothern coast of Drakengrad was not unlike this area, just much hotter.  The sapphire sea reflected sunlight like diamond shafts into the afternoon sky.  A bit of tension left Marius' shoulders as he took in the wonderful view before him.  The beach below was barely a sliver of sand against the cliff above that glowed nearly as brightly as the sun itself.  In the stark reflection below Marius caught sight of a white, featureless figure on the sand.  He caught the impression of white clothing and possibly a mane of jet hair.  A shocked expression flashed across Marius' face and disappeared just as quickly.  There was something familiar about this figure and, just as like a fever dream, it disappeared.  Marius took a shaky breath to steady his nerves and moved back towards Thyra.<br><br>"My lady, I would like to get this event moving.  It would seem that one of my duties calls as soon as this meeting concludes."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Thyra nodded, and rose from her seat. She approached the podium, the chatter amongst the students immediately falling to a pensive hush.<br><br>“Good morning, and welcome, students and staff of the Terminer Academy for Exceptional Youth. I’m so glad that all of you could make it today, and I eagerly look forward to working with each of you in the coming year. I am Thyra Russell, Superintendent and acting Principal of the school until further notice.”<br><br>“We, ah, do have a Principal currently on the payroll, but they are currently in deep space in order to deflect an incoming earthbound comet the size of Kentucky. So for the foreseeable future, I’ll be serving both roles.”<br><br>She inhaled deeply, and took a sip from the lukewarm glass of water at the side of her podium.<br><br>“Obviously, you all know the reason why you are here. However, for clarity’s sake, allow me to elucidate. The purpose of this school is to help you to live up to your fullest potential, which means educating you both in standard scholastic matters, but also coaching you in how to properly use your Powers, and also how fit into society without ending up on the news in Winstone.”<br><br>“Don’t make the mistake of thinking this is ‘Charles Xavier’s Academy for Raising a Bunch of Gifted Youngsters as a Powered Paramilitary Strikeforce.’,” Thyra raised her chin, and deliberately removed her sunglasses. Her gaze flicked from student to student as she continued speaking, “You all have been blessed with amazing talents, gifts beyond imagining. However, society has cultivated unhealthy expectations of us. They see us as terrorists, mercenaries, assassins, thieves, a culture of bloodthirsty thugs who approach every problem by violently leveraging our innate talents.”<br><br>“By and large,” Thyra turned her eyes towards the floor, “They’re right.”<br><br>Dark murmurs spread throughout the room.<br><br>“Enough,” Thyra squared her shoulders, and raised her voice, “I’ve been there, in the thick of it, ever since my powers manifested at twelve years old. I grew up in this. Me… my family, and my entire neighborhood were caught in the crossfire between two warring factions of Powers, and I was the only-“<br><br>Her voice broke. Blinking the tears out of her eyes, she resumed.<br><br>“I was the only survivor. I had virtually no guidance, and I only ended up where I am today because I stumbled into a group of Powers who were trying their best to make the world a better place. Lord only knows where I’d be without their guidance. Hundreds, thousands of other Powers will never be so fortunate.” <br><br>“The culture amongst us Powers is infantile, brutish, and violent. When the non-powered public decries us as a bunch of morally bankrupt murderers, our response has been, ‘Okay, sure, how much are you willing to pay me to kill somebody?’ By the time I was sixteen, I had met over fifty serial killers. Every single close friend I had through my adolescence was a felon. We assume because we’ve got skills that make us adept at fighting, that should be our first resort in all things.”<br><br>“I founded this school so that you all have a chance to rise above that. My hope… my prayer, is to show not only you, but also the rest of the world, that there is a better way. We don’t have to live in ignorance and violence, we can be something so much more than we’ve been aspiring to, than what humanity expects of us. This is your chance to change everything.”<br><br>Thyra carefully made eye contact with each student, her gaze open and warm.<br><br>“Please don’t waste it.”<br><br>The superintendent exhaled deeply.<br><br>“Anyways, we will now be proceeding with the introductions, in alphabetical order, by last name. If you’d all be so courteous, when your turn comes, please step to the front, state your name, tell us something about yourself, and provide a demonstration of your powers.”<br><br>“After that, there’s signup sheets for one-on-one talks with the faculty members, by the edge of the stage. These’ll be a mandatory part of your registration, so please don’t forget.”<br><br>“First up will be Evelyn Bertram. Thank you,” Thyra stepped away from the podium, and returned to her seat.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><i>Power demonstrations?  Seriously?</i> Talia thought to herself upon the end of Thyra’s speech.  She hadn’t been sure exactly what to make of the speech as a whole, but Thyra’s delve into her own broken past had touched Talia quite deeply.  While she had been uncertain if Thyra was trustworthy before, this made her feel as if they had something in common.  Then the whole idea of power demonstrations had come up and it took Talia completely by surprise.<br><br>She had just been reassured by Emily’s cupcake and comments just minutes ago that the staff at this school knew what she was capable of and now suddenly they wanted power demonstrations?  She sank into her seat, her face disappearing behind her book as she sighed heavily.  As her mind continued to mull over the idea, she wondered how extensive a demonstration they were looking for and whether they were aware of how much time she had spent trying to keep her powers reigned in.<br><br>Some ideas began to come to her and she sat back up, more focused now and flipped through the pages of her book before coming to a certain page and tracing her finger along several lines.  <i>If they want a demonstration I don’t intend to disappoint, but I have to make sure I keep my powers reigned back from my control limits</i> she thought to herself.  The safety of everyone in the building was her primary concern and while she was willing to shock and awe she was not willing to push things too far and risk a dangerous situation.<br><br><i>That clique on the bleachers surely won’t think I’m all smoke and mirrors after this</i>, not that she really cared.<br><br>If she was going to do this right then there were two items she would need and who better to ensure she had them than the woman who had asked for the demonstration.  She peered over the top of her book and narrowed her eyes at Thyra, concentrating on the sound waves bouncing around the room.  She bent them to her will and directed them to Thyra, focusing them into a generic sounding whisper in the superintendent's ears.<br><br>“If you want a proper demonstration of my powers…” the whisper began, “...then I need two things.  An empty drinking glass and one of those small, red bricks.  You can just leave them on the edge of the stage for me if you don’t mind.”<br><br>With that the whisper faded and Talia’s face slid back behind her book, though she knew that if the woman knew anything about her student’s abilities she would be able to guess who had just whispered to her.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"First up will be Evelyn Bertram. Thank you."<br><br>Eve snapped her pocket mirror shut, discretely slipping it into her clutch as she stood up. She was holding her posture and stepping more like she was floating down the bleachers, a trick Carlos didn't really understand but it was kind of impressive in itself. They'd already been talking about what they were planning when they got the announcement that they'd be showcasing their powers, Carlos wasn't really sure how he was supposed to demonstrate his, but Eve and Mel had been stumped too. It wasn't like they fit into neat little categories like Jay did <i>not that it's a bad thing, really, means we don't have to come up with anything</i>. Technically, Mel had already shown her skills off, but he didn't think messing with the other students counted.<br><br>It was like she was on a catwalk, he noticed. Every step was confident and it made her outfit flow around her, all drapey and it should have looked shapeless, it probably would have on anyone else, but it wrapped around her figure every time she moved <i>girl has got it on point</i>. If he hadn't met her, gotten to know her a bit better, he would have guessed she'd come to the wrong school, should have been learning Modelling and Catwalk Technique, not How To Not Accidentally Blow Someone Up With Your Powers 101. She got to centre stage <i>of course she did, centre stage means all eyes on her</i> and turned back to the rest of the auditorium.<br><br>"I'm Evelyn Bertram, Eve for short, and I'm from Kissimmee," she said clearly, one hand on her hip <i>and damn if that's not a sassy pose</i>. She flipped her hair over her shoulder, eyes drifting around the boys of the room briefly before she looked back to the bleachers. Carlos shot her a grin and a thumbs up. "I like fashion, I designed everything I'm wearing today." She gave a twirl, her outfit moving with her and next to him Jay wolf-whistled and punched his arm. <br><br>"My power is light manipulation," Eve continued and he knew for a fact that she'd rehearsed this part, she'd probably deny it until her last breath but he walked in on her practicing in front of a mirror, one of the very few times he'd seen her without any make-up on and he brought it up at every given opportunity. Her rehearsal was probably for the best, too, since the bits she hadn't rehearsed were coming across as stilted, which should have surprised him but it kind-of didn't. None of them were really experienced in public speaking. Evelyn was confident in every aspect of what she did and seeing her falter like this was just <i>so</i> out of character. They were better at hiding, never drawing attention to themselves and sticking to the shadows instead of standing out, loud and proud. Evelyn was the one of them who wanted the limelight, he knew that much from how she'd describe all the old glamour movies she used to watch. Her face would light up and there was just so much passion there, but it seemed like now that she had the attention, she was faltering under it.<br><br><i>Come on girl, you got this</i> he met her eye and nodded, putting on a smile that felt too big and it seemed to work. Evelyn was smiling back at him. She took a breath, like she was resetting herself, and looked back around the room.<br><br>"I focus my power through this mirror," she continued, pulling the mirror out of her clutch again and Carlos would have held that one a bit closer to his chest, personally. He didn't have any obvious handicaps to his skills, not like Evelyn's mirror or how Jay struggled with turning his strength on and off <i>unless he's doing it on purpose</i> so it wasn't as much as a concern for him, but Evelyn was pretty much admitting that taking the mirror away was the same as taking her powers away. "I can't do anything spectacular yet, but..."<br><br>She opened the mirror and closed her eyes for a second. The entire room dimmed, light still filtering in through the windows but it was like it was being blocked slightly, like someone had cast a thin sheet over the room. The surface of the mirror was glowing faintly, just bright enough to cast light over Evelyn's face and it reflected in her eyes, making them twinkle and sparkle. She smiled, wide and open, and raised her hand above her head. <i>No wonder she dimmed the lights first, this is incredible</i> the room was suddenly alive with lights, more than lights, shapes and colours that were shifting and cycling and dissipating only to form again not even seconds later. He saw a flash of purple immediately replaced by a wash of pale blue, like paint strokes in the air around them that only existed for moments at a time. It was a kaleidoscope on a massive scale, Carlos had seen Evelyn use her powers before a couple of times but it was never like this. He'd seen her using them like a torch or to get the perfect lighting for a selfie, never a show of colour that was... <i>spectacular.</i><br><br>There were shapes in those colours, half-formed things that were fading just as quickly and he saw a ball gown with ribbons and roses, he caught the wings of a bird soaring past and he was turning his head with every new movement, trying to keep up with what was happening. A rabbit sprinted past him and then there was a horse galloping, no, not a horse, a pegasus that flew past a palace. Everything was so bright, so vivid, but they had a ghost-like quality <i>made of light, not mass</i> that gave the whole scene a sort-of ethereal feel. The shapes were constantly moving and none of them fully realised, fading faster now and Carlos saw sweat threaten to emerge on Evelyn's forehead. She'd pushed herself too hard and he could see her trying to reign it back in, the images changing back into shapes, and then colours that swirled and spiralled around the room like magic. <br><br>As the last of the colours finally faded away, the dimness that had been cast over the room lifted again. Carlos blinked against the sudden sunlight streaming in through the window, letting his vision settle before looking back at Evelyn. She was still smiling and Carlos felt a surge in his chest, a warm feeling that he couldn't put a name to but he'd analyse that later. On the stage, Evelyn bowed and made her way back to the bleachers. He high-fived her as she passed him.<br><br>"That was fucking awesome," Jay said enthusiastically, grinning like an idiot.<br><br>"It was," Mel agreed, her smile warm and sincere and not a smirk for once.<br><br>Carlos agreed. It was fucking awesome.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Silumas</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Silumas was a calloused soul. Few things stirred the pieces of him other's would call their soul, or their heart. He had seen empires larger than Rome fall, he knew the inner workings of the cosmic spheres, and seen sights both blessed and cursed far beyond the small blue world of Earth. Yet, the Dark One saw those colors, that illusion of photons and a small, almost imperceptible smile brightened his face beneath his cowl. <i>This girl has real promise.<br></i><br><br>HIs true motivations for being at this school to teach the young Powers of Earth remained a mystery. Zebedee and Thyra had negotiated his place at the school (his original intentions were to take over the entirety of it, creating a more militaristic encampment than place of learning) and so it was his job to take the most volatile of the children and help them understand their place in the world. How someone who intended to subjugate this plane of existence a dozen years ago would do that was still something that likely troubled the school administration. But, as Emily had put it, who was going to tell him no?<br><br><br>As Eve finished her demonstration, Silumas folded his arms across his chest and entered a kind of meditation where he thought about probabilities and outcomes given specific choices. He could single the girl out now by announcing his thoughts on her potential. That would likely backfire on him. It was fairly obvious she had been practicing that demonstration for weeks, and while she enjoyed the limelight, turning her classmates into rivals this early would cause her to falter, not excel. He could also say nothing. That would most likely not produce any results for him whatsoever. She would continue as she was and maybe it would work to his advantage, maybe it would not. No, he had had to make her aware he was watching, he was expecting something great from her, but he needed to do so privately.<br><br><br>The Elementalist's hands formed a steeple in front of him, the gesture obvious and unnecessary, but he wanted her to know if she was watching what he was about to do. A scroll would slowly appear at her seat on the bleachers. It was not that it was whole and ever so snail-like appeared, it was if it could be seen to be created atom by atom in the span of a half-minute. It was almost like someone had burned the scroll at her seat and then put the reaction in reverse. The small sparks that popped off the rounded edges were not hot, but vanished as quickly as they appeared until finally it was whole.<br><br><br>The final product was something one might expect to see out of the movies. It was wider than a standard piece of paper, perhaps a foot wide and a couple long. It was sealed at the edge with a white wax and the emblem in it made it quite apparent who had caused the thing to appear. In the emblem were six colors in six symbols, arranged in a pentagram with five around the outside, one in the middle. On the top was a black skull, sitting like a head upon the white medieval shield in the middle. The right was an obvious flame etched in red, opposite a mountain the color of dark mud. The bottom of the image contained a kind of vortex the color of sand or a light maple syrup, next to a several azure lines in the form of waves.<br><br><br>The parchment itself felt old, very, very, VERY old. It was rough to the touch, a easily felt texture preventing a smooth surface, as might be expected of an original writing of the ancient Greek philosophers. Somehow, this thing seemed even older. It had the feel not of paper, but of a thin cloth. Breaking the seal had an audible snap to it, as if it had been there for a significantly long time and soaked into the cloth/paper concoction.<br><br><br>At first the parchment would be a bit difficult to unroll, feeling again as if it had been rolled like that for some time and had grown used to it. The edges were surprisingly clean, and with a careful inspection, it could be found to be a perfectly straight line, even down the arrangement of molecules. The writing on parchment was obviously very practiced but still hand written, as small smudges or slight irregularities in the font revealed imperfections. It was unclear what the bigger surprise was upon reading the script: what it said, or that the voice of the Elementalist could be heard by the reader in their mind.<br><br><br>"<i>Well done,</i>" the gravelly baritone of Silumas spoke from the script.<br><br><br>"<i>That was impressive indeed for someone of your age and obvious lack of training. With my help, you will be able to do things soon that even you never thought possible with that mirror,  and with the very existence around you. I have high expectations of you, Evelyn. Do not disappoint me,</i>" that last lined held a certain malevolence to it as it was spoken into the reader's mind. The obvious connotation being of great and unpleasant consequence.<br><br><br>There was no formal 'Thank you' or 'Sincerely' at the end, instead it was simply signed "Master Silumas." That signature, thankfully, was not spoken aloud.Should Eve decided to look in the Dark One's way, she would not find him staring or leering, instead respectfully watching the demonstration of the next student or faculty. In fact, the teacher gave no indication to her whatsoever that he had sent that her way. The congratulatory threat, or promise of expectation as Silumas would put it, simply hung in the air. <br><br><br><br><i>The girl has promise indeed.<br></i><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">AngelicTragedy</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Ty gazed in awe at the chromatic cascade that played around the gym that Eve created.  He'd seen some amazing light shows in his lifetime, even as far as seeing the auroras over Alaska once, but this was by far more impressive.  The shapes and figures danced around the desks, an owl flashed over Ty's head and faded before he could get a proper look at it.  A sudden thought struck Ty like a ton of bricks and the display around him lost its magic.  He'd not thought of preparing a presentation of his abilities, frankly he didn't even know what to do to show off his powers.  How does one show off something that they truly don't have full control over.  Ty sank slightly in his chair as Eve wrapped up her presentation and began back towards her seat.<br><br><i>Maybe the next person up will give me time to think of something to present.  The last thing I need is to make a fool of myself in front of the whole student body</i> Ty frantically thought as he watched Thyra rise from her seat and take the stage again.<br><br>"Next up will Be Titus Bolton.  Thank you." Thyra's clear voice cut Ty worse that any blade could as she gave me a look with not unkind eyes.<br><br>Ty pushed his chair back slowly and rose to his feet, knocking the seat backwards with an awkwardly placed foot.  He flushed and picked the chair back up with tight movements.  He couldn't remember a time where he had been this nervous and flustered in his life.  He'd befriended a nearly five hundred pound tiger, why was this so damn hard.  Ty forced himself to move on legs that still felt far to long for his body.  It had been a full year since his accident and he still hadn't gotten use to his new frame.  Ty felt like he was a newly born foal walking for the first time, stiff jointed and shaky.  Everyone in the crowd must be watching him and the thought was nearly to much to take as he had to mentally stop himself from taking a left at the end of the row of desks instead of a right and simply walk thought the doors and never come back.  He took a deep, harsh breath and began up the steps only to trip over himself and face plant right at center stage.<br><br><i>I may as well just quit school now and make things easier on myself</i>, Ty fought back to his feet and turned towards the auditorium with scarlet cheeks and ears.  Shame in himself and his body nearly crushed him in the moment as he faced his peers, feeling the eyes of the teaching staff behind him brought on a nausea so fierce that he thought he might choke on his own bile.<br><br>"My name is Titus Maxwell Bolton, but you can call me Ty.  It's a pleasure to meet you all," Ty managed a slight bow to the crowd.  Unconsciously, he plucked the rose he'd picked earlier in the morning and began snatching petals off of the bud.  Seconds that felt like hours passed as he stripped the flower of its delicate yellow petals before he could speak again.  "I'm fourteen years old and I'm from Eureka Springs, Arkansas in the US where I help my family at our big cat rescue there," Ty began ripping the petals into shards of what they once were, in the process staining his fingers yellow.  "My power is vector manipulation, though I'm afraid that I..."<br><br>The thought flashed deep in Ty's core like lightning.  The answer to his issue was in his stained fingers and it came about because he was so flustered.  A weary smile grew across Ty's face as he brought his hands to his lips, whispered a brief thanks, and then cast the destroyed flower high over his head.  In that moment the stiff movement and awkwardness vanished from him, instead Ty seemed graceful as if he was built for this and his body was truly his own.  The shower of petals began to fall around him as he pulled his arms in against his chest.  The paths of movement seemed to come to glowing life before his eyes.  Each tiny twitch, each possible path for each flake became clear as Ty's focus tightened on them, his mind exacted total control over them.  The petals began to swirl around him in an ever increasing speed and then began to rise and fall creating a whirling shield of yellow plant matter.  No piece touched the ground or him, none of the petals could escape Ty's absolute control.  Sweat beaded on his forehead at the total focus the presentation took, but Ty pressed on.<br><br><i>I've got to keep up for a moment longer.  Remember what mother said, big finish.</i><br><br>Ty put his right hand out before him palm up.  The petals flowed down into the space above his flesh and swirled into a loose ball of writhing yellow.  A graceful snap of his wrist brought the ball to the center of the gym before exploding with a light snap, showering the rows of desks in fragments of honey colored flakes.  Each bit was spaced out evenly across the floor, no clumps or gaps were to be seen.  If Ty had more material it could be reasoned that the auditorium would be carpeted with golden snow.  Ty visibly shook on the stage and bowed once again, this time to both the students and the staff.<br><br>Ty stumbled back to his desk and dusted off his seat before collapsing into it.  He let his head sag backwards before reaching into his bag for a cloth to wipe off his brow.  He was totally wiped of energy.  The only other time he'd ever felt this totally drained was when he'd had his accident.  Ty knew he pushed himself completely to far but something felt right about the whole display.  There was a voice far in the back of his mind that approved of his efforts and he felt the need to push himself again.  He felt a hunger to grow stronger, a need to improve that told him that anything was possible.  This was the first time that Ty had ever felt good about his power and wasn't utterly afraid that he was going to end up aging into nothingness.  Ty felt human again.<br><br><i>Hopefully I didn't make to much of a fool of myself</i></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Upon hearing the whisper, Thyra looked up. Talia was the only student it could have reasonably came from, unless Mel (Or Silumas!) had taken to playing pranks on her. She looked to the blonde, but the young girl had already buried her face in a book. Thyra hardly could fault her; after she'd lost her parents, she'd spent the next four years using sunglasses to hide her emotions whenever her own emotions had overtaken her. By the time she'd gotten a better handle on her self, the sunglasses had become so synonymous with her that she just decided to roll with it.<br><br>Eventually, for her own good, they'd need to coax Talia out of her shell, but that could wait. They had months and months to work with her, and forcing somebody to cope before they were ready was even worse than not helping them at all.<br><br>Thyra leaned over and whispered something to Emily, who nodded enthusiastically. A moment later, she'd cartwheeled off the stage and gone flying out the side exit.<br>--------<br>Almudena had slumped back into her seat when the superwhatever had been talking, one arm on the back of her chair, the other on her desk. She didn't really get what Miss Russell was going on about, but then again, at her school, they never really had heard much about the Archipelago. Summoners were bad, something weird happened at el Ansonia a while back, and there were Powers here.<br><br>The woman was going on and on about responsible use of the Powers, but it was going in one ear and right out the other. Almudena's power made her good at punching things. No, no, no, <i>El Mejor</i> at punching things. If she'd been given such a talent from God, then it was a waste not to put it to use. Just because some of the Powers gave them all a bad name wasn't a reason to buckle down and play nice; no, if that was the case, it behooved the good Powers to beat some sense into the bad ones! She cracked her neck, and then her knuckles, one by one, idly ignoring the last of the speech.<br><br>It was then that one of the prissy girls took the stage. Almudena raised an eyebrow as she explained her powers. It didn't seem all that- The room exploded into a fantasy landscape of ethereal colors, like a somebody had scooped up a dream and dumped it into the auditorium. The latina sat up in her seat, craning her neck to pick out all the details. Every sign the other girl had given pegged her as being shallow, but damn if she couldn't put on a show. Off to her side, she saw the girl with pigtails, Dalisay, reaching out to touch a spiraling cloud of rainbow-winged faeries. Almudena herself tilted her head to let a flying narwhal breach past her.<br><br>As the colors faded, Almudena had a huge grin on her face. She tried to meet Evie's gaze as she stepped down from the stage, conveying her approval with the warmest nod she could manage.<br><br>It was then that el Mariapalito stepped up to the stage. Alma really hadn't heard much from him, besides his griping about bullies, but that was to be expected. Stick bugs like him didn't go jumping into things aggressively- They hung back, and let life fly by them, blending into the scenery. A grasshopper like her couldn't really wrap their head around why somebody would live like that, but she wouldn't begrudge him his nature.<br><br>As he began swirling the petals, Almudena found herself leaning forward in her seat. The showmanship was something she'd expected from the fashionista, but this one was a surprise. The movements that the boy was making- Her practiced eye noted that these felt natural, instinctual for him. As the shredded rose exploded through the room, Almudena gamely swiped her hand in front of her face, catching the flecks that would have blown into her hair. In the aftermath, a brief silence fell over the room.<br><br>Almudena began clapping, not just with her hands, but with the projection of her powers. The noise echoed through the room, normal claps accompanied by what sounded like smashing two bricks together. Soon, Garth had joined her, and then several more of the students. Applause swept through the room, just as the rose petals had.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Eira and (though he'd never admit it) Aodhan teared up a bit at Miss Thyra's speech. They were the only family they had and losing each other would literally be the end of the line for both of them. Live for each other, die with each other. That's how they lived. They didn't know any other way.  <br><br>Harue looked away from the twins and to her desk, wiggling in her seat uncomfortably.  She knew allot of powers had stories of loss and sadness. It made her feel out of place. She had a good home, a good family, good friends, if it hadn't been for the incident in her last school, she would still be there now.  It wasn't that she wished she had a story like them, no she would never wish that, but not having the shared experience made her feel like an poser here.  Glancing to her other side she saw Jesse who seemed to have zoned out again. Her mouth moved with the words Thyra spoke like she'd heard this speech a hundred times and knew it by heart.  The sight of her and the Spanish girl down the way not taking it so seriously made her feel a little better. <br><br>The comfort was short lived, however, ending at the mention of demonstrations. She looked down at her hands and then over to the little fire extinguisher. Well, if she was going to do this, she was going to need something sharp... Suddenly the light dimmed, animals with other beautiful shapes began to form and vanish. She had been so focused on what she was going to do, Harue realized she'd missed the introduction of the blonde on stage. She sure didn't miss her powers though! They were amazing! <br><br>Next up was someone named Titus. At first she thought he might be one of the teachers because of how much older he looked, but the thought was soon dispelled.  He looked just as nervous as she felt as he took the stage.  She listened and watched with what she hoped was a reassuring smile on her face. Vector manipulation was something she wasn't really familiar with, but it sure sounded cool. The older boy's features seemed to shift and just like that, tattered petals swirled through the room. It appeared very natural for him as he moved. Something else Harue felt she lacked with her own powers. She sank down lower into her seat. Well, the sooner they called her up, the sooner she could get this day over with. <br><br>Petal pieces few into Eira's face making her giggle, a grin spread across her face. She looked over at her brother just in time to see a stray petal fly into his open mouth triggering a coughing fit. She harder as she pounded on his back. Aodhan coughed and hacked. He had been so enthralled with the the two powers that he hadn't realized he'd left his mouth agape. Finally he hacked up the little culprit catching his breath.<br><br>“Not funny.” He glared half jokingly at his sister who waved it off.<br><br>“So for ours, should we do one of our stories?” She chattered excitedly.<br><br>“Definitely! What one you think we should do?” Aodhan leaned in so they could whisper out the details. <br><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Thyra stepped up on stage again to announce the next student.<br><br>“Next we have Jesse Chase. Thank you.” A few seconds of silence passed. Jesse made no move to get up and in fact appeared bored, like she hadn't heard her named being called at all. <br><br>“Jesse Chase.” Thyra said more pointedly at the light brown haired girl. Jesse jumped at the second announcement.<br><br>“Oh! Chase! Right. Sorry, sorry. I forgot my last name there for a second!” She laughed, sprinted to the front and took the stage. <br><br>“Hello there fellow students! It's wonderful seeing you all here again. Let me introduce myself. I am Jesse Chase, Interdimentional Telepath. Now, I know what you're thinking,” Jesse gave a quick wink at her joke (That may or may not have been in Garth's direction.) then continued on with a distressed hand held to her forehead. <br><br>“'Oh no! I have to be careful about what I think around her.', 'How will I keep all my secrets and the stash of sweets I smuggled into school away from her?!' Well, don't worry ladies and gentleman, I am here to allay your concerns. I can only read my own mind! Quite a shock, I know. The sweet stashes, however, may still be in danger.” She looked at everyone seriously, hands on her hips. She heard a cough from the otherwise silent audience. <br><br>“Wow... Tough crowd. That went over so much better in JB4...” She mumbled to herself.<br><br>“Well, I might not be so flashy as our last two lovely performances, but I can calculate the future 98% better than any rum fortune teller. Let us test the theory, shall we? My demonstration will play out during the course of our time here!” She put a finger to her lips. <br><br>“Hmm, I don't want to spoil too much for you all. I'll just drop a few hints then.” Jesse grinned out at the familiar faces in front and behind her.<br><br>“Garth!” She pointed to the pale blonde. “Awesome astronomy man!” her eyes flickered to Silumas then back to Garth, “And good luck!” she gave Garth two thumbs-up. Next she turned to her classmate.<br><br>“Harue, you should duck later... I mean, you don't have to, but you might want to.” Jesse gave a shrug as Harue fixed her with a withered look. <br><br>“Almudena, amiga! Just please don't use my chair. I know it's only the first day of school, but I've grown quite attached already.” The twins were snickering in their own seats by now. <br><br>“Ah! Finally! But you stay out of trouble the both of ya!” She winked at them. Then there was the girl with her nose berried in a book.<br><br>“Talia, look to the future and you'll do just fine.” She smiled encouragingly at her, then squinted her eyes as she thought, “That sounded more like a fortune cookie... I did say 98%.” Jesse quoted her disclaimer. <br><br>“But that's not all folks! Grab your flying monkeys and eat that popcorn, because Deandre has somethings super super awesome coming up, but I promised I wouldn't tell. Though I very very much want to! That will be all.” She turned to walk off the stage then turned quickly back. “Umm...It'll all make sense later. You're up, Deandre!!” She grinned and scampered off stage and back to her loved chair.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia had payed very little attention to Evelyn even after she reached the stage until the lights suddenly dimmed and then lots of shapes, colors, animals, flowers and assorted other things, that barely seemed to finish forming before they faded away again, flashed around the room.  She had to admit that the display was impressive and almost theatrical.  Talia also noticed that the molecular vibrations of Evelyn’s nervous system seemed to increase dramatically during her light show, but those of the mirror curiously remained the same.<br><br><i>Seems like that took a lot out of her</i> she thought to herself as watched her seeming to struggle slightly at the end with just a hint of sweat forming on her brow.<br><br>Next up was the student with the altered body and bizarre molecular vibrations that appeared to be in his twenties.  She watched as he stumbled over himself as if he wasn’t used to his own body and even face planted once he reached the stage.  She sighed lightly and actually felt a bit sorry for him.  Titus, she had heard was his name and <i>he’s only fourteen?  Really?  What happened to this poor kid?</i>  She thought as she waited for him to begin, but he seemed nervous as if he wasn’t sure what do exactly.<br><br><i>Vector manipulation huh?</i>  His power immediately interested her because it sounded sciencey like hers.  Talia smiled a bit as the yellow flower petals he’d thrown into the air suddenly began to swirl around him and continued for several minutes before exploding across the room and showering everyone close to the stage.  The display seemed very fluid and natural as if he was really in his element.<br><br>The next student called up was Jesse Chase, the young woman who Talia believed had a very bizarre case of multiple personality disorder.  <i>She forgot her name?</i>  More likely a different personality was at the forefront of her mind at the time of the first announcement of her name.  Then the girl said something about being an interdimensional telepath and predicting the future, which sounded like something straight of a science fiction novel, as if those had ever really been fiction.  Once the girl made her way up to the stage and began to speak Talia was baffled by how rapidly her molecular brain vibrations pinged between different patterns.  It was as if a data stream were flowing through her mind as she spoke, recalling odd memories and handing out vague hints to students.<br><br>Suddenly the girl said her name and looked right at her and Talia blinked and met her gaze over the top edge of the book.  “Talia, look to the future and you’ll do just fine.”  The girl offered happily.  She was uncertain how to respond and so she just gave a weak smile over the top of the book before hiding her face in the pages again as the girl continued on, saying something about a person named Deandre.<br><br><i>Look to the future and you’ll do just fine.</i>  She repeated in her mind, but she wasn’t certain what to make of it.  How was she to look to the future when she was not the one who could see it?  It was not something that she could simply shrug off, but it was something that she couldn’t wrap her head around and so she pushed it to the back of her mind.<br><br><i>Look to the future?

Though Deandre was looking forward less and less to the view from the stage with each step, he couldn't see a polite way to hang back. He had no choice but to step up on stage. All eyes were on him. Feeling very small inside his puffy blue hoodie, Deandre now regretted that he hadn't spoken to any of the other students yet: None of them (except for maybe the possibly-clairvoyant Jessie, and what game <i>she</i> was playing he couldn't tell) was already in a position to expect what he was going to say.<br><br>"My name is Deandre," he allowed, "I'm from the US, and..."<br><br>His fingers tightened around the notebook's spine. There was nothing else now.<br><br>He addressed the superintendent in something closer to a mumble. "Miss Russell, I'd really rather not give a demonstration, if that's all right."<br><br>The superintendent's gaze flicked out towards the gathered students, barely visible beneath her sunglasses. Her lips worked quietly for a second, as if searching for what to say.<br><br>"Ah, Deandre, that... Yes, that would be acceptable."<br><br>Thyra turned toward the rest of the students. "We're demonstrating our powers here today in order to normalize the concept of being a Power. The vast majority of you have grown up without ever even seeing another one of our kind, and so showing what we all have in common here is a massive step forward for each of you. However, some powers..." Thyra paused for a scant moment that seemed much, much longer to Deandre. "...Can foster mistrust, through the nature of their existence."<br><br>Deandre's gaze was fixed on the floor of the stage. He now felt very cold.<br><br>"This isn't an indictment of their wielder, mind you, but I do believe it'd be best to actually get to know the person who possesses said powers before you make any judgments about them. As such, I am waiving the requirement for Deandre to demonstrate his abilities for us today."<br><br>With a feeling that was in one part gratitude and in another part not, Deandre said, "Thank you, ma'am," and then, "I'm sorry," and then he walked offstage.<br><br>Scattered whispers and murmurs sounded him off, and he forced himself to look up at the others in the auditorium as he made his way back. Most, if they were looking back at him, wore expressions somewhere between puzzlement and concern. Emily Schwartzwald had nothing but a huge, sincere grin to send his way; well, <i>she</i> wasn't worried by him, but seeing as how she seemed a little off even for these surroundings, it wasn't the greatest comfort. He glanced at Jessie, now seated again among her group, to find her frowning at him, yet it seemed like less an accusing glare than something of... disappointed confusion? But if she hadn't been expecting him to welsh like this, then what <i>had</i> she expected, when Deandre had known from the moment Miss Russell announced the demonstrations that any display of his power would be as pointlessly non-theatrical as it was frightening?<br><br>Oh Deandre wished Miss Russell had just sent him offstage without the commentary, the <i>reassurance</i>, which did nothing but announce to his classmates that there was something here worth shunning.<br><br>Yet he couldn't face the hike up the bleachers back to his original seat. Wanting to shrink out of sight as quickly as possible, he took an open desk not far from the weedy blond boy and the Catholic schoolgirl, pulled the pen from his pocket, and, no longer looking at anyone, began to write.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4723159').toggle();if($('#spoiler4723159').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4723159">This is definitely the weakest thing I've written in this thread so far, but I couldn't figure out a way to make it not-terrible</div><br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>Carlos snapped out of his daze at Jay's voice. The guy who looked way too old to be a student was on the stage and <i>who would want to work at a cat rescue</i> he suppressed a shudder at his words, but his attention was brought back to his friends. Evelyn had something in her hands, a scroll that looked like it had been taken straight from a movie set, and Jay and Mel were both looking at it suspiciously. <br><br>"Where'd that come from?" He asked, reaching over to take it from Evelyn. There was a seal holding it in its curled shape, an honest-to-God wax seal with an emblem and everything, and he turned it over in his hands a few times to try to figure out what the thing was made of <i>this isn't paper, it's like someone robbed from the scrap bin from a clothes store</i>. The emblem was ridiculously intricate. He recognized the general look of a pentagram, he was pretty sure he'd seen the elements being portrayed on the points before, but the sheer level of detail in each of those symbols <i>there's no way this was done with a stamp</i> were a sure sign magic was involved somehow.<br><br>"I don't know, it was just on the seat next to me," Evelyn answered, twirling a lock of hair around her finger. Carlos glanced back at the stage and saw the twenty-something year old throwing something yellow over his head, but he flicked his attention back to the scroll as he handed it to Mel. "It wasn't there when we sat down."<br><br>"It feels like magic," Mel added, running her index finger over the seal. "There's traces in the seal, all over really but it's stronger in the seal."<br><br>"So what does it say?" Jay asked impatiently, grabbing for it. Mel hit the back of his hand with the scroll and he withdrew it quickly, not quite pouting but Carlos knew he wasn't that far away. She cracked the seal and uncurled the sheet but lost her grip on the end and it promptly curled up again. Scowling, she uncurled it again and held both ends firmly <i>scowling isn't gonna make that thing obey you</i>, apparently choosing to ignore Carlos grinning.<br><br>He looked at the writing on the page <i>that's a big sheet of paper for not a lot of writing</i> but as soon as he started reading, he could hear a voice that definitely wasn't his own booming in his skull. His eyes instantly flickered to the girl who still had her face in a book. It could be her, he was pretty sure she was the one who'd been trying to taunt Evelyn's make-up. No, that was different <i>that was still something we could hear</i>. The voice wasn't coming from outside, it was in his head and he felt the blood leave his face. It had a terrifying quality, the voice was confident but it was the kind of confidence that could be backed up, not empty threats or boasting but matter-of-fact. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Evelyn sink into her seat when she was directly addressed and at that point, he knew his friends could hear the same thing he could.<br><br>"It's gotta be that teacher," Jay said as soon as the voice stopped talking. "You know, the psycho one. The one who's bad news."<br><br>"I think we get the idea, Jay," Carlos replied, smacking him lightly on the shoulder to try and detract from the waver in his voice. <br><br><i>That was fucking terrifying</i> the fact that the voice was sounding in his head, not coming from outside, was what was scaring him the most. If someone could get their voice in his head, what else could they do? Could they put images in there? Or could they see something? Could they go rummaging around his memories and look at anything?<br><br>"He's singled you out," Mel said slowly, looking at the words on the page. "It's like he's recruiting. He might dish these out to anyone who shows a lot of power."<br><br>"So, what, you impress Mister Psycho up there and get invited to join his psycho club for psychos?" Jay asked skeptically.<br><br>"It's not exactly a great recruitment strategy," Carlos agreed. "Throw someone across the room then send vaguely threatening notes to people. I can see people lining up now."<br><br>"Melanie Europa is next. Melanie, would you please take the stage?"<br><br>The superintendent's voice cut through their conversation and Carlos looked at Mel, catching the tail-end of her eye-roll. <br><br>"Hard pass. No," Mel replied.<br><br>"Mel," Evelyn said sternly, frowning at her.<br><br>"Ugh, fine."<br><br>Mel was confident, like Evelyn, but it was a different type of confidence. Evelyn had the grace and posture of a model on the catwalk, showing off but making it look effortless and every movement was controlled and precise. Mel, on the other hand, was walking with a kind of confidence that Carlos had seen in Powers on television; she was ready to get into a fight at any moment <i>there hasn't actually been a fight yet, that's impressive</i> and she thought she'd be able to hold her own, maybe even win. Carlos sat up a bit straighter, watching his friend ascend the stage. He'd caught Evelyn when she'd been practicing but he had no idea what Mel was planning.<br><br>"I'm Mel, I'm seventeen and I'm from Celadon," she said, mimicking Evelyn and flipping her hair over her shoulder. "Eve designed everything I'm wearing today too, and I once managed to see a Helen Mercury show for free."<br><br>She was holding the spotlight better than Evelyn had, Carlos had suspected she would even though she looked like the entire thing was a waste of time. He didn't know if she actually thought that or if she was putting it on. There was a lot that he didn't know about Mel, she kept a lot to herself and only really shared when she wanted to, not when she was asked <i>Eve probably gets it all in their dorms, girl talk, I dunno</i>. <br><br>"I can use magic," she continued, and she opened her mouth like she was about to say something else but instead pursed her lips, debating her word choice. "Well, why don't I just show you instead of going on about it."<br><br>This, Carlos was looking forward to. When he'd interrupted Evelyn's practicing, the dark-haired girl hadn't accidentally shown anything nearly as big or vibrant as the light show, he hadn't expected the display to be so grand. Mel, though, Mel was still keeping a lot to herself. He knew already that she needed to say a rhyme, sort of like an incantation, and then magic happened, but she'd deliberately not explained that. She started to twirl and <i>she should consider an career as ventriloquist if this stage-magic thing doesn't work out</i> her lips were moving but only barely, hidden by her spinning. As she gained momentum, sparkles started forming and flowing around her clothes, growing in number and brightness as she spun faster. <br><br>Her clothes started changing, not like the way the psycho-teacher's had melted, more like they were warping into something different. The black leather of her jacket and slipping down and blending with the deep purple of her tank top, her jeans were shifting and melding into a skirt and the entire thing was lightening. Each turn brought some volume to her clothes as they changed, now a dress with a v-neck but a high collar and cinched at the waist. The skirt had layers and layers of fabric that accentuated her hips and fell at irregular intervals that should have made Carlos hate it <i>that should be a sign of bad designing, where's she pulled this skirt from? It actually works</i> but didn't. He glanced at Evelyn to gauge her reaction, ignoring Jay's gawking. Her lips were pursed, she'd probably already seen something she didn't like but Carlos knew that they weren't completely synced up with their tastes.<br><br>As Mel's twirling slowly came to a halt, cocky grin plastered on her face, Carlos lead the applause. Sure, it wasn't the big, showy display that Evelyn had done but it was <i>so</i> Mel. Just enough to show off a small scope of what she could do but not big enough to give away any particular weakness or limitation. When he caught her eye, he shot her a grin and a wave, and then she was spinning back the other way now and it was like someone had hit a re-wind button, the skirt pulling back up and thinning out, the top splitting out and re-forming into the tank-top and jacket combination. As soon as her clothes had been completely restored, she gave a small curtsy <i>how the hell did she manage to make a curtsy sarcastic</i> and jumped off the stage.<br><br>"I didn't like the neckline," Evelyn said as soon as Mel sat back down with them.<br><br>"Whatever, Eve," Mel retorted with a shrug.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Hey," Almudena whispered loudly as Deandre slinked back to his seat. He feigned not noticing her, so she proceeded to pull a pencil from her pocket, and chucked it at the side of his head.<br><br>"Hey, Andre, what's up?" Not giving him a chance to answer, she kept talking, "You don't have to tell us, but me and Furball were trying to figure out what your power is, and we were hoping you could tell us if either one of us was correcto, por favor."<br><br>Garth blushed, and averted his eyes.<br><br>"Actually, I was just venturing a guess... I wasn't hoping to pressure you into actually telling us or anything," He hissed, shooting a smoldering glare at Almudena.<br><br>"Hey, you're curious too, can't hide that," Alma retorted. She put her elbow on her desk, and leaned in towards Deandre, "I guessed you had X-ray vision. That's why you keep looking over at me, si?"<br><br>"And I told her that he keeps looking over at you <i>because you keep making a scene</i>," Garth fiddled with the multicolored folders stacked on his desk.<br><br>"To be honest, from what I know of Thyra, I guessed she was alluding to what your power actually was," The blonde shrugged, "So I'm guessing your power is making people doubt or disbelieve what other people are saying. After all, it'd be useless to <i>demonstrate</i> that, wouldn't it? You'd be like 'my power is making people not believe me, watch', and then we'd be like 'we don't believe you'."<br><br>“Garth Firbolg,” Thyra called out, waving a hand towards him. Garth smiled serenely, shucked off his fleece pullover, and draped it over the back of his seat. <br><br>"Well guys, it looks like I'm up," He casually ambled to the stage, running his fingers through his hair.<br><br>“Thank you, Thyra,” Garth lost his composure, immediately appearing flustered, “I mean, Miss Russell.”<br><br>Thyra allowed herself a slight smirk, “It’s okay Garth.”<br><br>“So, anyways, I’m Garth Firbolg. I’m eighteen years old, a senior, and I come from Brightmeadow-“<br><br>The country girl who had arrived late let out a celebratory whoop, sloshing her jug of apple cider.<br><br>“Okayyy, well, anyways, my parents work at a feed store warehouse thing, providing grain for the cattle-“<br><br>The girl gave another echoing holler, obviously pleased to hear this.<br><br>“Is- Is she okay?” Garth glanced over to Thyra, who nodded stoically.<br><br>“Just energetic, and extra excited since she’s not the only person from her hometown.”<br><br>“Oh, that’s cool,” Garth gulped, and faced back towards his peers, “Anyways, back in Brightmeadow High, I was in our jazz band and marching band, playing the trumpet in both. Other than that, I’m-“<br><br>He could see Almudena rolling her hand at the wrist, gesturing for him to hurry up.<br><br>“Oh, right, I’m a Power. I… I probably should demonstrate that for you guys.”<br><br>Garth took two steps, and hopped down off the stage, keeping a hand on the edge to steady himself. He raised his forearm, fist clenched. Inhaling deeply, he unclenched his hand. A sphere of golden flames erupted out of his palm, casting the room in saffron hues. He took hold of his wrist with his free hand, steadying it.<br><br>The youth began slowly, deliberately walking a curved path with measured steps, the globe still hovering directly above his palm. As he moved, an inferno trailed behind it, forming a blazing arc where he had been. The conflagration slowly shifted in color, first into a sunset orange, and then shading into a brilliant apple red. Garth completed the first half of his circle, and began heading back to where he’d first ignited. The semicircle shifted in color again, becoming a neon violet. Garth came around to the end of his flametrail, and gently pushed the sphere into it, connecting the circle. As it closed, it became a brilliant cornflower blue.<br><br>Garth stood still, idly balancing the merry-go-round sized ring of fire on the palm of his hand.<br><br>“So, you can control fire? Never seen that before!” One of the students catcalled from the back of them room.<br><br>“What’s next, are you going to fly?”<br><br>“Oh, he did that already!”<br><br>Garth cleared his throat loudly. When that failed to quiet his naysayers, he flicked the edge of the inferno. Instantly, a roiling wave of coruscating sparks exploded from the bottom of the ring. The iridescent embers blew towards the ceiling, dappling the entire room with rainbow motes.<br><br>“I’ve got a lot more where that came from. Brace yourselves,” Garth took hold of the hoop, his seemingly delicate hand completely unmarred by the roaring inferno. With a grunt of effort, he pulled down on the edge, and set the entire circle spinning in midair, as if it were a coin flipped by a giant.<br><br>Garth caught it on its edge, the towering inferno almost high enough to reach the support struts in the gym roof. He let his eyes drift shut, digging his fingers into the strobing flame. In the center of the ring, a pane of inky blackness flecked in white appeared. <br><br>“So, you know how Thyra mentioned that comet the size of Kentucky?” Garth gestured towards the starscape that he held, “I figured I’d give all of you a closer look.”<br><br>In the center of the vast starscape, a blue-grey dot faintly appeared. It began growing in size, the grayish portion resolving itself as a lopsided sphere surrounded by a corona of cerulean vapors roiling off of it. Garth opened his eyes and smiled proudly, even as the onrushing comet began to loom menacingly large.<br><br>“Now, mind you, this is a portal, so if I don’t do this right, this thing will come through and we’ll all be obliterated, along with about three quarters of the Asian continent. Oh, and a planetary nuclear winter,” Garth grinned slyly, “I hate when those happen.”<br><br>Within his circle of verdant flames, the immense expanse of the comet filled the entire field of vision. What seemed like small bumps and divots were soon revealed to be titanic mountains and crevasses. The nearest peak jutted forth, as if it was aimed directly towards the class. <br><br>“And so…” Garth planted his feet, and shoved the ring. It flipped in a semicircle, flashing back to a shade of goldenrod as he pointed the onrushing apocalypse towards the faculty. Thyra jumped to her feet, Silumas arched an eyebrow, and Belwyn dove for cover. Emily, who had just re-entered the room carrying the supplies for Talia, gave a cheerful whoop. She bounded onto the stage, caught Thyra by the shoulder, and pulled her close. Producing a camera from one of her myriad pockets, she beamed and snapped a selfie with the end of the world looming over them.<br><br>Garth seized the edge of the gilded inferno, and with all his might, gave it a shove, spinning it like a wheel. As it spun, it grew smaller and smaller, irising in on itself, and brighter and brighter. Flashing a vibrant orange, the ring collapsed on itself. It left behind only a disproportionately small puff of pumpkin colored smoke and a few wafting sparks.<br><br>TINK! A chunk of ice from the very tip comet, the size of a man’s thumb, hit the rim of Thyra’s glass on the podium. It bounced into the water with a plop.<br><br>The pyromancer turned back towards his peers. He flourished with his right hand, trailing a nimbus of crimson flames as he moved. Sweeping his arm low, he gave a deep bow.<br><br>“And <i>that</i> is my power.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Feeling slightly hot in the face, Deandre allowed, "He's closer," and gestured toward Garth as the thin white boy got up to move toward the front; then Deandre had enough time to wonder why he had blurted this out. He'd stepped right into playing the game they'd made up, and, well, why not, though? Would he have said it if he didn't <i>want</i> to play that game? The dark-haired girl's smile had caught him off-guard. He glanced sidelong at her, briefly torn between hoping she was going to press the topic further and hoping she was giving it up - but there, obviously, her attention was on Garth as he stepped onstage, and really that was what Deandre preferred. He flipped back a couple of pages to the entry he had started on Garth before learning the boy's name.<br><br>And then Garth showed the room a miracle like Deandre had never seen.<br><br><s>WEEDY</s> BOY - GARTH FURBOLG<br>THIN <br>FIRE CONTROL - DIFF COLORS  - FIRE RING: WINDOW?<br><u>SPACE</u> - COMET!! MS RUSSELL WAS N/JOKING<br>CLOSE PORTAL - CHUNK OF COMET!<br><br>He would have to write up a full recounting and mark it with a star later. In the meantime he had to put down his pen and book to applaud with the rest of them after Garth finished his performance. Watching the white boy take a deep bow amid cheers on either side, Deandre could sense the familiar feeling of regret creeping up behind his own amazement. Wasn't there a chance they would have clapped a little for his power? Hadn't he been stupid to--? But there was no point rehashing it. An opportunity wasted, that was all. The Hispanic girl gave an exuberant whoop.<br><br>Deandre could smile at him, too. That much he could do.<br><br>But his smile faded when the robed teacher with the snake-haired insignia, younger but no less stern-looking than the bald man, strode up and spoke a clearly admonitory word into Garth's ear, accompanied by a tight shoulder squeeze. This was apparently too much for the thin boy, who reeled under the pressure, his hair falling into his eyes. Another student, the boy in blue and gold who had helped Garth up earlier, broke from the desks and ran onstage to support him again. Deandre was stunned. The covetable spectacle of Garth's demonstration had put all thoughts of his earlier mishap with the bald teacher from Deandre's mind, but the truth was plain now: Garth's power had nothing to do with resilience or endurance. As a matter of fact he was exactly as frail as he looked. Why had <i>two</i> teachers now used excessive physical discipline on a boy who made twiggy Deandre look like a football player?<br><br>The same question was obviously on the Hispanic girl's mind; she'd clapped a hand to her mouth. "How's that allowed...?" he asked her. "They keep going at him, I don't get it. Anyone tell <i>you</i> they'd be throwing students around? Not that they'd try that with you, I guess... I mean, because you'd floor them. But the rest of us..."<br><br>He was talking strangely fast. This wasn't like a boy from Georgia. Well, it was vaguely awkward to acknowledge that he'd watched her punching that doughnut into a cloud of sugar earlier: Deandre didn't know her name. He'd been distracted and hadn't been keeping track when Miss Schwartzwald had been passing out the cupcakes to this area, of course.

He vaguely remembered an explosion of applause as he sat down but that was the last clear memory he had. Chunks of action assaulted Ty's mind in rapid fire; vague predictions of the future, major disappointment in the assembly, sparkles spinning on stage, and finally a moving circular inferno. As his wits slowly returned to a more normal level a chill exploded into the gym so potent that it took Ty's breath away. The jagged, frosted tip of space rock centered in his vision just as the gate shut and Thyra was struck by the frigid finger of the earthbound titan. The chill hung heavy deep in Ty's chest and made him flex his fingers in a fruitless attempt to warm them. <br> <br>That was impressive. I've got to remember not to cross that one. <br> <br>~*~*~*~*~*~ <br> <br>Though only the most trained eyes would notice it, Marius was primed to duck or dodge as the situation dictated. This was the first demonstration that had stirred Marius' blood, truth be told Garth had frightened the battle hardened general. Marius loosened his tensed muscles, dusted himself off from the frosty spray that accompanied the comet, and rose to his full height. A pair of sure strides brought Marius up to Thyra's left shoulder and he grasped her shoulder briefly with a calloused hand. Marius strode forward towards the edge of stage towards Garth. Marius turned Garth back towards the staff and placed his mouth near his ear. <br> <br>"Mr. Firbolg, while I understand that the demonstration is a part of the orientation today, I would like to remind you that we are not here to do harm to either the students or staff. As such, I have to ask you to never do that indoors again unless the proper safety measures are taken. Please remember that, Mr. Firbolg." <br> <br>Marius grabbed Garth by the shoulder and put firm pressure on the joint to drive the point home before beginning back the podium. Marius gave Thyra a brief knod and glided back to his seat. Marius resigned himself to his thoughts as he sat.  Garth's powers reminded him of the use of silver magics in Drakengrad. Perhaps Garth was at least part Aldra-Sa. It wasn't unheard of for a few Aldra-Sa to leave their ancestral homes to marry and reproduce. Marius closed his eyes and made a mental note to delve into Garth's file when he was able to get to his office. <br> <br>~*~*~*~*~*~ <br> <br>The doors to the auditorium crashed open just as Marius left Garth center stage and a young woman clammered into the room before coming to a sudden halt just inside. Though she entered in a mad rush not a single strand of hair or piece of clothing was mussed or out of place. Her sudden halt of movement sent her emerald colored tunic to swishing over coal black leggings. Three long golden necklaces with miniature bells sang around her neck and a pair of tiny golden bells tinkles with each movement of her feet as the dangled from her weathered brown leather boots. Her every movement was a cacophony of jingling yet the sound wasn't as annoying as one would think, the sound was more like snatchs of song than irritating. With a sure hand she pushed her hair away from her face with a black satin glove. <br> <br>"Sorry I'm late everyone, my boat was late in docking. I hope that didn't miss anythin' major!"  <br> <br>Her voice was lyrical with a Scottish accent, her smile infectious, her mane of wavy red hair seemed to move in an unseen breeze. There was an air of absolute optimism about her as she slipped into a desk directly next to the grouping of younger girls, humming to herself. The young woman leaned forward towards Deandre and Almudena. <br> <br>"Anythin' I need filled in on?" she asked with a smile that spread from ear to ear.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">After Jesse’s display and her words to Talia, she had become deeply absorbed in her own thoughts, almost withdrawing into her own mind.  She barely even took note of Thyra’s announcement that Deandre was not being required to demonstrate his powers and something about fostering mistrust.<br><br><i>Look to the future and you’ll do just fine.</i>  What did it mean?<br><br>She withdrew deeper, scanning her past within her own mind and tracking the evolution of her powers ever since their manifestation.  There was only one clear vector that she could find, they had just kept growing more and more powerful while her ability to control them seemed to remain at the same level.  She had little memory of the time when they first manifested, it was like a blank space or a black hole in her memory, but the progress of things from that point forward seemed clear enough.<br><br><i>Look to the future and you’ll do just fine.</i><br><br>It began to grate on her, she could not comprehend what meaning there was to this suggestion when everything else thus far suggested...she sighed suddenly <i>what future could I possibly have?  Someone whose powers will eventually either be the end of them or everyone else around them.</i><br><br>She felt a tinge of anger in her chest and closed her eyes, breathing deeply to try and ward it off before it festered and posed a threat.  The clique on the bleachers seemed to be quietly riled up about something, but Talia thought nothing of it while she was focused on calming herself.<br><br>As her mood returned to normal, and she pushed all of her thoughts and worries to the back of her mind, she caught the tail end of the magical fashion shift of the purple haired girl from the bleacher clique.  The morphing of her outfit back to what she had originally been wearing earlier was interesting, but she felt Evelyn’s light show had been more impressive.<br><br>“Garth Firbolg.”  She heard Thyra call out as she waved for him to come on stage.  Talia had noticed the two of them speaking earlier on and it seemed as if they knew each other from before the academy.  She also recognized him as the boy that had been sent flying across the room by the evil looking man on stage.<br><br>As he spoke one of the girls near where he’d been sitting kept hollering for some reason after he mentioned Brightmeadow.  She wasn’t sure where that was, but apparently they were both from there, but had somehow never met <i>big place maybe?</i>  She thought.<br><br>Talia smiled a bit as Garth created his ring of colorful flames, it was a beautiful display after all, but she noticed that during his demonstration the molecular vibrations of his entire body seemed...strained.  It was as if whatever allowed him this power was also taking a severe toll on his body, perhaps something they had in common, both their powers posed a threat to them personally in some way.<br><br>Suddenly the demonstration took a rather...unexpected…turn.  The center of the massive ring of flames suddenly became what looked like a starry abyss.  Talia knew right away that this was no illusion even before Garth mentioned the comet Thyra had spoken of in her speech.  While the molecular vibrations of the air around the edges of the roaring ring of flames were what she normally expected from a fire, what she felt once the starscape appeared was somehow distressing.<br><br>The air directly in front of and behind the starscape in the ring felt normal, but her senses passed through the ring as well and into the starscape beyond, but there was nothing.  The vacuum of space had no molecular vibrations at all and suddenly Talia’s heart began to pound in her chest.  A panic swept over her like she had only ever felt when she was forced to wear clothing that blocked or muffled her vibratory senses and she began to tremble, eyes wide.<br><br>Surprisingly as the comet loomed closer and closer to the ‘portal’, as Garth had called it, her vibratory senses began picking up on it and while everyone else seemed to begin panicking, Talia began to calm as the comet gave her senses something to latch onto beyond the portal.  The closer it got the less of the void her senses picked up on and the calmer she became.  After a few more minutes, and while Talia was catching her breath, Garth closed the portal just in the nick of time.  She wasn’t certain if the fact that the comet actually calmed her panic attack rather than worsened it was reason for concern or not, but then again, the prospect of her own death rarely if ever rattled her.<br><br>Several minutes later Talia observed one of the faculty members holding Garth’s shoulder rather tightly and scolding him.<br><br>"Mr. Firbolg, while I understand that the demonstration is a part of the orientation today, I would like to remind you that we are not here to do harm to either the students or staff. As such, I have to ask you to never do that indoors again unless the proper safety measures are taken. Please remember that, Mr. Firbolg."  The man had said into Garth’s ear.<br><br>Talia frowned a bit as she began to wonder if her demonstrating her powers was even a good idea at all.  While they were perfectly safe if she remained in control, if that control slipped, even a little, her demo had the potential to quickly escalate into a lethal disaster.  She gazed at Thyra over the top of her book, wondering if she had any idea of her issues.  What Garth had done, while dangerous, was done deliberately and he was clearly in full control of the situation.  For Talia, however, that was not always the case and she had no real way of knowing if her control would slip, it was something that just happened whenever.<br><br>Talia narrowed her focus on the ambient sound in the auditorium and focused it into a generic whisper in Garth’s ears as she had done earlier and also prayed he would not flip out and get himself thrown across the room again.  “Beautiful display”, the whisper began, “I enjoyed the colors and you demonstrated control very well with the portal to space.  Genius taking us all on a field trip without us actually having to leave.”  The whisper paused for several minutes.<br><br>“Your power…” the whisper resumed, “...it’s killing you...isn’t it?”  The whisper sounded rather somber on that last note and then it faded and was gone.  Talia kept her face hidden in her book the entire time, not yet ready for him to know who was whispering to him.  She had watched people die before in the past and she wasn’t thrilled about potentially watching it again, but something about Garth intrigued her none the less.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Flint.” Thyra called looking down at the list.<br><br>Looking up from his cupcake Flint glanced around the room until his eyes settled on the teacher.  The room was still filled with the after effects of Garth’s demonstration.  Small embers drifted to the floor in a vast array of colors. Each shade glimmered in contrast to his ice blue eyes. The rainbow luminescence reminded Flint of the lights in the sky back home. They would shift overhead like the flow of water as he sat in the snow and stared at the mirror like water that bordered his home to the west. Boats would sail through the peaceful stillness as their captains warned of the events that such lights foretold. It was a shame that those old fogies still believed in such legends. But they told good stories when they brought in their hauls of fish, and who was he to doubt things that people considered long dead or nonexistent.<br><br>“Flint!” Thyra called louder.<br><br>Snapping back to the present Flint stood up and stuffed the rest of the cupcake into his mouth. This bite seemed different than the others; it was like something foreign had found its way into the god given pastry. Reaching into his mouth, Flint extracted a small piece of paper that had been hidden underneath the tantalizing treat. The notes red ink was slightly smeared but still readable.  <br><br>“<font color="red">Dear Flint, tell your friend Zagaroth thank you for the flowers. But also tell him he's not invited to school with you, and if he shows up, I've got a fun activity with toothpicks, lemon juice, ghost peppers, and a waffle iron planned for him! Your friend, EMILY &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</font>.”<br><br>“I should start counting the reasons to kill this woman. Who ruins a cupcake with a note?” Flint thought to himself as he walked passed Almudena on his way to the stage. Each step created small frost rings that rapidly disappeared. Reaching the platform he turned toward the staff and bowed. Pulling the small book from his pocket Flint skimmed through the pages while glancing at the staff member who had arrived since the cupcake incident.  Stuffing the book into his back pocket he turned to the students.<br><br>“My name is Flint. I would share my last name but it is difficult for you guys to write and say so I’m going to skip it for now. I am 16 years old and I am a junior this year. I come from a town in Greenland, kinda……. But I guess I should just demonstrate my power.”<br><br>Cupping both hands in front of his mouth Flint slowly breathed into his palms. A small snowflake began to form and slowly grew larger and larger, expanding into an intricate web of delicate hexagonal patterns. As the chrysalis structure grew it glided toward the center of the gym until it came to a rest over the student’s head.  Bursting into tiny particles, the snowflake drifted toward the floor. Each particle floated around the students before settling on the furniture and floors. Jagged shards and pillars erupted from the ground filling the room with ice.<br><br>“This seems a little barbaric doesn’t it? I guess we can fix that.”<br><br>Jumping down from the stage, Flint landed lightly on the gym floor. A sudden transformation came over the ice as his foot touched the ground.  The previously jagged ice became smooth and Flint began sliding around his makeshift ice skating rink. Each movement seemed smooth and graceful as he slid back and forth through the room. One of the many pillars loomed over Flint as he came to a stop near the bleachers.<br><br>“Still have to do something about those pillars though.”<br><br>Flint’s lips curled into a small smile as he brought his fists together. The room’s temperature began to drop as he uttered a word in the language of the Gelhaim.  Frost began to form around each fist as he slowly spread them apart. A pole formed between his hands. Wrapping around the shaft, two serpents created spiral designs until they came together and bit each other on the neck creating a hollow ring that formed the base of the spears blade.<br><br>“I met a guy once that had this really cool spear so I model mine after his. I think his name was George and he said something about going to kill a dragon.”<br><br>Suddenly the spear became a blur and the pillar disappeared under a shower of ice chips. As the powder settled the pillar became visible once again. The crude ice pedestal had been transformed into a sculpture of Mel. <br><br>“That’s definitely an improvement. I think my blade work is rusty though.”<br><br>Tiny black veins began to spread into the spears handle near Flint’s hands causing the ice to seem darker.<br><br>“Not good, not good, not good. I should probably hurry the rest of this up.” He muttered under his breath.<br> <br>Skating back toward the stage Flint leaped onto the platform.  As he stopped in front of Emily and Belwyn the spear burst into tiny shards that swarmed around his body.<br><br>“Could you two both put out a hand? If he gave you a flower it’s only right that I do to.”<br><br>Both teachers extended a hand and the floating shards of ice collected in their palms. At first it was hard to see what was being formed, but as the pieces accumulated the two women could see the beginnings of a rose.  A few more seconds passed before all of the shards settled into their designated place.<br><br>“I guess that’s good enough for now.”<br><br>Skating back to his seat Flint sat down next to Almudena.<br><br>“Do you think I over did it?”   <br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Jesse hit her forehead with the palm of her hand and sank down in her seat after Dreandre took his own again. How could she have made such a massive mistake? She wouldn't blame him if he hated her right now.  She definitely needed to find a way to make it up to him. The possibility that he was upset with what she did, didn't sit well with her.  Closing her eyes, Jesse saw anything besides darkness behind her lids. A handful of voices and a barrage of colors met her mind's eye. This warranted some looking into. <br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Harue glanced around the room. Duck later? Because that's not vague in a room full of powers.  She leaned in closer to Jesse as she watched Mel take the stage.<br><br>“If you're going to tell me to duck you might as well be a little more specific.” She whispered to Jesse, expecting a response. After a length of silence she finally looked at the other girl. Her eyes were closed though you could see her eyes shifting underneath her lids and her lips moved slightly. <br><br>“And she's gone again...” Harue sighed. “Well, at least now I know she's not insane...mostly...” <br><br>Sparkling and movement caught Harue's attention in her peripheral. She looked back at the stage where Mel proceeded to dazzled her audience. What had she said? Something about using magic? Maybe she should have been taking notes on everyone.    <br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Aodhan and Eira stopped their plotting when they saw a fire user was on stage. <br><br>“Oooo!” Eira nudged her brother, “We definitely have to get him to teach you how he gets those colors with his flames.”   Aodhan crossed his arms and grudgingly at the other fire user. <br><br>“I can do that,” he scoffed. Eira snorted at him. <br><br>“Uh huh, sure you can.” <br><br>A few taunts erupted from the crowd.<br><br>“So, you can control fire? Never seen that before!” <br><br>“What’s next, are you going to fly?” <br><br>“Oh, he did that already!” <br><br>The twins looked at each other. <br><br>“Suddenly I feel like we should rethink our plan...” Eira nodded in agreement. <br><br>“Wait. He flew? Did he jet pack in here or something?” Aodhan shrugged.<br><br>“We got here at the same time remem-”Garth's sparks erupted skyward, silencing the room. <br><br>“So, you know how Thyra mentioned that comet the size of Kentucky?” Garth gestured towards the starscape that he held, “I figured I’d give all of you a closer look.” <br><br>Both redhead's mouths hung open in awe. <br><br>“You can't do that.” Eira said matter a factly, wide eyes still staring at the portal.<br><br>“Nope. Definitely can't do that.” Aodhan shook his head as if to clear his vision. <br><br>“Now, mind you, this is a portal, so if I don’t do this right, this thing will come through and we’ll all be obliterated, along with about three quarters of the Asian continent. Oh, and a planetary nuclear winter,” Garth grinned slyly, “I hate when those happen.” <br><br>The twins grew increasingly nervous along with everyone else in the room as the comet drew closer. Well,  almost everyone else in the room. All the commotion going on seemed to catch Jesse's attention, who was now clapping emphatically, cheering Garth on. <br><br>“I told you there would be some awesome astronomy! And to think I almost missed it!” She said excitedly.  Looking down, two similar scared expressions greeted her. Jesse smiled kindly at the twins and pulled the twins into a tight hug. <br><br>“Don't worry kiddos, he has a handle on it.” Normally the brother and sister would have been squirming away from the awkward embrace of the still potentially nutty girl, but both decided it was oddly comforting given current circumstances. <br><br>TINK! A chunk of ice from the very tip comet, the size of a man’s thumb, hit the rim of Thyra’s glass on the podium. It bounced into the water with a plop.<br><br>The pyromancer turned back towards his peers. He flourished with his right hand, trailing a nimbus of crimson flames as he moved. Sweeping his arm low, he gave a deep bow.<br><br>“And that is my power.” <br><br>Jesse started another round of applause and the twins jumped away quickly seeing that the immediate danger was gone.  <br><br>Harue peeked up from her panic position behind her chair at the sound of the newest arrival. The girl looked to be around the same age as her. Though, Harue herself always looked younger than her actual age, often being mistaken for being in early middle school. The weird white haired middle schooler. That was her.<br><br>"Anythin' I need filled in on?" She overheard the redhead ask, a smile was spread across her face.  <br><br>Harue took her seat again, smiling back somewhat sheepishly as she smoothed down the invisible wrinkles in her black leggings. “Things escalated quickly you could say.”<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Belwyn tried to discreetly slide back up into her seat having taken cover under the table during the impending doom.  Looking back on it, she wasn't sure exactly what she had hoped it would do to protect her against the comet. She looked around at her peers discreetly from the corner of her eye and slowly let out the breath she had been holding. At least no one seemed to notice. If she was really lucky she might have even escaped Emily's camera eye. Thyra seemed to regain her composure second only to said brunette who had retaken her seat next to the newly emerged Belwyn. Lightly scarred fingers played with the silky front strands of her black, wavy hair out of habit as the next student was announce.<br><br>“Flint.” Thyra's voice rang clear through the whispers of the students.  <br><br>Belwyn smiled reassuringly at Flint as he walked up to the stage.  He wasn't really one to show any stage fright, in fact, she wasn't even sure if he felt any stage fright, but he was her friend and she wanted to show him her support none the less. This wasn't the first time she had seen his powers in action, but it would be interesting to see what he liked to do with them given a non life threatening situation. He rarely ever just “played” around with them. Not in front of her anyway. She nudged Emily once Flint's back was turned.<br><br>“Hey, Emily, could I get copies of these pictures? I was hoping to get some from, you know, before too. I was thinking I might start my own album.”  She whispered, watching the giant snowflake burst over head. A stray snowflake landed, tickling her nose as it melted. <br><br>“Achoo!” Belwyn squeaked out a sneeze from behind her hand. “Excuse me.” She said with a little sniff. <br><br>Some of the students jumped as the ice pillars erupted from the floor, but others had smiles on their faces. Eira's smile was stood out in particular with glee and perhaps a little admiration as well. <br> <br>The demonstration was quite enjoyable. Belwyn thought she even saw a little smirk find it's way onto Flint's face as he skated around. It was good he was able to have some fun. <br><br>An intricate spear appeared in the ice user's hand as a bit of show and tell, then suddenly became a blur of movement as it hacked away at the pillar. This time none of the ice chips traveled far enough to hit the young woman in the face, for which she was very thankful. If she was being completely honest she had had enough of being buried under snow for a long time to come. <br><br>As the powder settled the pillar became visible once again. The crude ice pedestal had been transformed into a sculpture of Mel. <br><br>“That’s definitely an improvement. I think my blade work is rusty though.”  Belwyn frowned as she saw the ice of his blade turn a shade darker. Maybe that just happened when he got tired? She tried to reason it with herself. It had never happened before, though. After the incident in Greenland, she wagered it would be best to talk to him about it sooner rather than later. <br><br>Belwyn's concerned thoughts were interrupted as Flint hopped back on the stage, striding toward her and Emily.  The spear in his hand burst into snowflakes and small ice shards that again threatened to send her into another sneezing fit. She hoped she wasn't coming down with something. She'd have to remember to do an essential oils treatment on herself before bed that night. <br><br>“Could you two both put out a hand? If he gave you a flower it’s only right that I do to.” Belwyn gave a  light smile and extended her hand out to the white haired boy. <br><br>One by one the shards came together to create a delicate rose. The process sent gentle prickles of cold through her palm, but it was nothing painful. When it was finished, it rested lightly in her warm hand.   It really was a lovely thing, icey white petals faded to clear in an intricate design throughout the bloom. Judging from the lack of pooling water on the table in front of her, this flower wouldn't melt any time soon, but she was definitely keeping it in the freezer when she got home just in case.  </div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Ben noticed things.<br> <br>He'd noticed a lot since he walked into the room. He'd seen the group on the bleachers, all high-fashion and quiet conversation. He'd seen the loner students, the girl with her face in a book and the guy who was constantly writing. He'd even noticed the way the teachers were interacting, all of them looking hesitant around the one who had randomly, magically, changed into robes.<br> <br>Keeping track of the light show? He noticed a lot.<br> <br>There was, what he thought was, a phoenix soaring above. A pegasus passing a palace. A group of fairies, each with iridescent wings that kept on changing colours. He stepped to the side, for a fleeting second he thought that the narwhal passing him was real, despite the logical (and mostly ignored) part of his brain telling him that it was just an illusion. Given that he'd seen other students actively ducking out of the way of other illusions, he wasn't embarrassed about his own reaction.<br> <br>"No hace nada fase de usted?" Almudena asked, looking at the illusions instead of him.<br> <br>"Leo mucho," Ben replied. It wasn't an answer, not really, but it'd do.<br> <br>Ignoring her questioning look, he turned his attention back to the next student climbing the stage. It was the guy, he looked too old to be a student but too young to be a teacher and he had picked a seat not far from Garth and Almudena. There was a lack of grace to his movements, tripping over his feet as though he hadn't expected them to hit the ground in the way they had and his words were pretty much the same. He was playing with a flower, shredding the petals as he spoke, and it was like a light flickered on in his head. Mid-sentence, he threw the petals over his head and fell back into what had a passing resemblence to a Tai Chi position, not unlike the pose he'd sunk into when firing the cider. The petals swirled around him as though caught in a tornado (admittedly a small tornado, Ben considered) but it didn't look like there was any danger of them getting away from Ty. His control really must have been well-practiced to be this precise, the flurry of yellow not hitting Ty but also not flowing out to the rest of the room.<br> <br>Ben instinctively threw his hands in front of his face as the petals exploded across the room, catching a couple that would have hit him (and okay, maybe he was a bit concerned about the force they were moving but no one had to know that). Looking at the floor, he wasn't about to get a ruler to check but he guessed every individual fleck of yellow was spaced across the room equidistant from each other. He joined in the applause, nodding to Ty as he passed and flashing him a grin.<br> <br>As the next student, Jesse, bounded around the room, he did his best to hear what she was saying to people. He caught snippets and it wasn't until she was in front of them, talking to Garth, that he could properly hear a full sentence. What he'd been expecting, he didn't really know but it wasn't a pair of completely unrelated sentences to Garth and Almudena. He looked between the pair, trying to see a link between chairs, astrology and his new acquaintances, before it clicked in his head and he realised Jesse was (potentially) predicting the future.<br><br>Deandre took the stage next and from seat to stage, the boy was looking uncomfortable. Ben watched and Deandre was starting... average, he looked nervous and Ben couldn't honestly say he was surprised when the darker-skinned boy asked to leave without a presentation. He wasn't going to give it a second thought until the superintendent was talking about trust and that was interesting. Her words had a soothing tone, but Deandre was looking anything but soothed, and he saw the way the other boy faltered on his way back to his seat.<br><br>"Garth Firbolg."<br><br>Ben was looking forward to this one. He'd already shown that his power was both flames and colourful, so where the smaller boy was gonna take them, he had no idea. He'd expected the flames, Garth hadn't seemed particularly bothered by using them for mundane utility, but the disc that was flipping through the air was interesting. It was... if he had to describe it, it was like a coin being flipped before gravity happened. <br><br><i>Oh holy fuck.</i><br><br>Ben had never thought about what a comet would look like, up-close and personal, and what he could see was living up to his non-existant expectations. The were rises and falls, valleys and cliffs and, for some reason, he logically knew that this comet was a threat but he trusted that it wouldn't hurt him. He could see the curves of the valleys and the jagged edges of the ice and suddenly the rainbow was blinding his vision and he heard a <i>tink</i> and whatever Garth had done was gone.<br><br>There was applause and he clapped along, but it was taking him a moment to get his thoughts together again.<br><br><i>I just saw a comet and it could have killed us,</i> was what kept on rolling around his head, but he snapped back when he saw one of the teachers, the uptight-looking one, clap his hand to Garth's shoulder. It wouldn't have bothered him, but he saw Garth's entire posture drop. The blond boy was shakinng and his eyes were glazed, he looked like he was about to pass out, and Ben ran for the stage.<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>"Carlos Hew, would you please take the stage?"<br><br>And he jumped up to his name, landing two rows down and then walking with a complete lack of urgency. The stage wasn't particularly interesting as far as he was concerned, he'd already clocked the devices that were probably set aside for him and besides, hacking servers was boring. No, he saw something a lot more interesting about half-way along one of the walls, he'd sort-of noticed them before but didn't really register what they were, but if they were what he thought they were <i>a bit of technological fiddling never hurt anyone</i>. Ignoring the whispering that was going around, probably because he was walking but it wasn't towards the stage, he approached the panel and set about figuring out how to access it.<br><br>"Carlos, we didn't know what you might be planning for your demonstration so we've supplied some things on the stage, we have a laptop, a smartphone, a... a..."<br><br>He ignored the superintendent and applied just a bit of pressure and the entire panel opened up. This was gonna be interesting, the entire interface was more than touch-screen, holographic and it wasn't like the average keyboard. He ran his hand through the lights and his mind exploded into numbers and images and letters and symbols,<i> no, more than that</i>, it was flashes of light and electricity and dead ends, it was a maze that needed navigating but he knew the route and followed it to its end, and the console lit up.<br><br>"Carlos? Is everything okay?"<br><br>"Yeah, just messing around with your weird-ass set up in here," he shouted back over his shoulder, not really taking his eyes off the moniter but throwing out enough so the superintendent didn't feel neglected.<br><br>It wasn't human technology and he vaguely noted that fact while he was messing around, already knowing what he could prod and poke and what would end in system failure. He wasn't particularly interested in system failure since he could tell what would happen, and he had no interest in being the sole survivor in a group off charred corpses. Instead, he felt the way the way the floor was held together and just... tweaked it <i>Jay would get a kick out of this if he knew what it was</i>.<br><br>"Hey, Jay!" He shouted over his shoulder. "Get to the bottom step and take a step!"<br><br>He turned back to the access panel, moving his fingers this way and that and turned around. Jay, for once in his life, was looking apprehensive. He shot a glare at Carlos and tentatively lowered his foot to the wood panelling of the gym floor. Carlos turned back to the moniter, trying to hide the grin that was forming, until he heard...<br><br>"Dude, I can't believe you trusted me on this," Carlos shouted as Jay fell flat on his ass, and he couldn't help the grin that was on his face <i>he's gonna kill me for this, but... worth it</i>. He quickly turned around and flicked his hands to set the floor back to factory settings. Jay looked tentative when he got back to his feet, and Carlos laughed when he jumped, just that little bit too quickly, back on to the bleachers.<br><br>"What did you do?"<br><br>Carlos turned to the voice, male for once, and saw the teacher on the stage looking at him. He was the one with the brown, spiky hair and he looked more curious than anything else <i>I fucked around with your access panel and you know I do technology, seriously?</i><br><br>"I made the floor frictionless in a couple spots," Carlos replied with a shrug.<br><br>He saw the sudden concern in the superintendent's expression and the impressed look on shorts-and-vest teacher's face and didn't care either way <i>you knew I could mess with this stuff and left it out in the open?</i> as he turned and wandered back to his seat in the bleachers. Jay looked annoyed, but he took his opportunity to grab the bigger boy's head and ruffle his hair before dropping back into his seat.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"S- sorry," Garth mumbled in response, barely getting the words out before Marius let go of him. The boy took two shaky steps, and stumbled. He fell, landing hard on his knees. A deep, wracking cough exploded out of him, buckling his whole body. Before he could breath, he coughed again, wheezing from the lack of air in his lungs. Garth choked and spluttered, bringing his hands up over his mouth. He managed half a gasp before another hacking cough caught him. He fell to his hands and knees, his whole body shuddering violently.<br><br>Somewhere in the middle of his hacking, Garth realized Ben was at his side. He attempted a reassuring grin, snot and tears running down his face, and began wheezing violently again.<br>----<br>Thyra took one look at the scene before her, and spun on her heel.<br><br>“<b>Marius</b>,” She took three steps across the stage, and stood over the seated warrior, her shoulders tense.<br><br>“This is not the manner of learning environment that I wish to foster,” Thyra didn’t raise her voice in the least, but there was an icy edge to her tone.<br><br>“Just because none of us can prevent Silumas from manhandling our students does <b>not</b> mean that it’s acceptable behavior for the rest of our faculty,” Thyra put her hand on Marius’ shoulder, and turned towards Garth, who Ben was half-carrying back to his seat. Her voice lowered, her tone hushed.<br><br>“Do we really want to teach these children that the best way to get your way is brute physical force? That boy... Your lord, Valon, has actually told me he believes that some day, Garth’s power could even outstrip his own. Do we want to teach him how to merciful and respectful, or do we want to bring up one of the most dangerous Powers in the entire world to think the right approach to any conflict is throwing his weight around and bullying people?”<br><br>Thyra took her hand off his shoulder, and began walking back to her seat.<br><br>“That said, I’ll be having a word with him about showmanship and safety after class today. I’ll take care of things. Just remember, Marius... This isn’t the military any more. These are just kids, after all.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Silumas</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Just because none of us can prevent Silumas from manhandling our students does not mean that it's acceptable behavior for the rest of the faculty..."<br><br><br><br>The words caught Silumas off-guard. He had been paying a lot of attention to the boy named Garth, the one he had thrown across the room because of his severe lack of respect. If Thyra were paying any attention, she would see something no one had seen in almost six thousand years: shame and regret on Silumas' face. He had intended to teach the boy respect for his superiors, both in hierarchy and ability, but looking at him now he seemed weak, fragile, and vulnerable. The boy was just that, a boy. Like Silumas had been so very long ago. And, just as had been done to him, he brutalized him in order to teach him. Silumas was turning into the creature that drove his hatred, his entire motivation for scouring the multiverse with a purposeful malice. <br><br>And, Silumas was ashamed for a moment.<br><br>He composed himself quite rapidly, however, and it lasted only a breath or two, before his face returned to the stern frown it had been before. Evelyn would make a powerful ally one day, and if he lived to see it so would Garth. So, as the young man returned to his seat Garth would find a scroll very much like Evelyn's from before awaiting him. The wax seal expertly crafted and applied, reflecting the six symbols of Elementalism.<br><br>"Garth Firbolg,<br><br>You demonstrate a level of ability uncommon to this world. For a mere Earthling, I must say that I am impressed. You still have much to learn, however," Silumas' voice could be heard to those reading the elaborate and near-perfect script.<br><br>"Most importantly, you need to learn respect. I believe my earlier lesson taught you respect for your superiors, and I doubt you will make me repeat it. You, however, must also learn respect for yourself. It is obvious your abilities are killing you, draining you of all that bring you Life. That is a dangerous fire to play with, but lucky for you I can teach you to overcome that limitation."<br><br>"Like the others here I expect great things from, do not disappoint me," his voice became supremely sinister towards the end, a strong hint of pain should such a let down occur.<br><br>The letter was signed Silumas, though no voice echoed the script.<br><br><br><br>Should Garth make eye contact with Silumas he would find the teacher glaring at him, though aside from the dark fire that roared within his gaze, Garth also so something of an apology, even encouragement from the Magus. Silumas intended to teach these children how to control themselves, and their abilities, so that they could do what he could not: save the one's they loved.<br><br><br><br>If and when Garth looked his way shortly after Silumas turned his attention to Marius, "I would ask you leave his discipline to me in the future, Head Boy. I suspect that after some time in my tutelage he will far outstrip your own abilities and require a..." Silumas gave the smallest of smiles, "more powerful discipline."<br><br>The Elementalist would then lean towards Emily and politely whispered, "And, my lady, I ask that should Ms. Bertram require instruction or discipline that you involve me. She will become a very..." he paused trying to think of the right words, "special individual to this planet. Someone upon whom everyone's very survival will depend. It is my duty to ensure she gets to the point that when we place all of our hopes upon her they are not dashed like a wave against a rock."<br><br><br><br><br><br>OOC:<br>SO SORRY AT, I have nothing but the highest regards for you, your characters, and your writing, but someone had to become the brunt of Silumas's arrogance....

They were the same size as the legs on the chair that Garth had been sat on before his demonstration, and Kilik put two and two together. The exact event that had thrown Garth from Silumas was still something he needed to put together, but he'd figured out enough. He pulled out his phone and started firing off a text.<br><br>"I think we'd be better off leaving that up to the kids, Silumas," Kilik interjected, looking at his phone rather than the mage but his tone was clear enough. Not confrontational, but still as authoritative as Thyra's.<br><br><i>Not everyone responds to that sort of teaching style, and the fact that you've mentioned disciplining the kids twice is making me feel like you shouldn't be left alone around any of them,</i> he thought, and he would have said it if it wasn't for the prospective fight that would immediately follow.<br> <br>He slipped his phone back into his pocket and levelled his gaze on the other teacher, his expression hard for the first time.<br><br>"I'll speak to you after the demonstration is over, if you don't mind," he said, his voice clear and holding the same authority that Thyra had. "If you'll excuse me, one of our students needs attention."<br><br>Kilik jumped off the stage, headed for Garth.<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Ben half-carried, half-dragged Garth back to the nearest seat, ignoring Garth's half-hearted attempt at reassuring him. Hell, if he didn't think Garth's ego would take a major hit, he would have either fireman- or bridal-lifted him back to a seat. Any seat, at this point. He knelt down in front of the blond boy, the boy who looked like he could pass out at any moment, and caught his chin before he could doze off. Garth's skin, hell, his jaw and skull and every bone felt delicate under Ben's hand right now.<br><br>"Hey, Garth, are you okay?"<br><br>And Ben got a half-hearted grunt in response. <br><br>"Garth, come on, stay with me for a second," Ben persisted, moving Garth's head so that he was making eye contact. Kind of. Garth's eyes were glazed over and unfocused. "Hey, dude, you were great. Your comet thing, it was awesome, you got a standing ovation."<br><br>Ben was trying to get Garth to focus back in on what was going on. He didn't know the ins-and-outs of what was going on, but his new friend was clearly suffering some kind of breakdown. If he wanted to do something about it, he needed to know what was going on, and that meant that he needed to bring Garth back to the present, which was... proving difficult.<br><br>"Ben, I can help," a voice behind him said. He turned his head, and saw one of the teachers stood behind him. It was the tall one, the one who had come in with the messenger bag and his brain supplied the name. Kilik. Ben nudged himself away and watched as Kilik took the same stance that Ben had previously been in. <br><br>"Hey, Garth," Kilik said and there was something soothing in his voice, it was calm and level and in-control. "Can you see me?"<br><br>Garth's eyes were still out of focus, but Ben could see a conscious effort to try to focus them. It was a twitch of a finger, one eyebrow moving, movement of the lips. Ignoring Kilik, he moved forward and grabbed Garth's hand, his thumb rubbing circles.<br><br>"Garth, Kilik's trying to help you," he said, and he kept the waver out of his voice. He still didn't really know what was going on, Garth had just gone into shut-down mode, but Kilik was nodding at him, so clearly he was doing something right. He threw a questioning look at Kilik, because what was he supposed to do at this point? "Garth, can you see me?"<br><br>Garth's eyes flickered open and Ben felt the pills being pressed into his hand, though he couldn't figure out a way to give them to Garth. He gripped Garth's hand tightly and leaned in to his ear.<br><br>"Kilik's given me these pills, are you okay with taking them?"<br><br>Garth nodded and that was all the incentive Ben needed. He grabbed the nearest cup of whatever and placed the pills in Garth's mouth, then raised the cup to his lips and let him drink what he needed to. As soon as the cup was taken away Garth coughed again, and it was an ugly cough, one that wracked his whole body but it stopped at one cough. He could see the strength return to Garth's limbs, the colour flush into his expresion. Ben figured he could, at least, try to make light of the situation.<br><br>"No offence, Garth, but you look like shit."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"That's..." Garth coughed again, ragged and wet. He turned away from Ben, and retched up a huge gob of bloody phlegm. As discretely as possible, he spat it to the floor. The boy turned back towards Ben, deflated and meek, and croaked out the end of his sentence, "That's Ophiuchus for you."<br><br>Garth shakily sat up, leaning heavily on his arms. His knuckles stood out, pale white that looked like they were ready to jut through his skin.<br><br>"I'm sorry about all..." He looked away, a few more tears running his cheeks, "All of that. My power isn't..."<br><br>He tilted his head, but it made his vision swim. Garth shook himself to clarity, and pushed himself back up in his seat.<br><br>"It's not compatible with my soul, according to the experts I spoke with. If I push myself too hard-" Garth sighed, and used a sweep of his palms to indicate his mucus spattered shirt, "This happens."<br><br>"I knew I could do this whole thing... I've been practicing for weeks," <i>Ever since I went to Greece</i> Garth noted mentally. He wiped his hands on his already sullied shirt.<br><br>"I just-" Garth coughed, this one quiet and controlled, "I can choke down the consequences as long as I've got my focus... I would've been woozy and congested all day, but I wasn't expecting anybody to break my focus like that. It makes the backlash a lot worse, because it hits me all at once, then."<br><br>Garth's pullover slapped him across the face, and plopped into his lap. He tried his best to shoot an indignant glare at whoever had pelted him with it, and found Almudena waving to him warmly. Sheepishly, Garth began pushing his way into the garment, using it to cover up the mess he'd made of his outfit.<br><br>"Hey," Garth started saying, his head stuck in the neck-hole of the fleece. With a bit of a struggle, he pulled it the rest of the way on. He took a single wary glance around the room, and looked back to Ben, "Thanks. You really saved me up there. I... I honestly don't know what they would have done, if you hadn't stepped in."<br><br>The boy's smile was as faint as the rest of him, but his eyes gleamed.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Sooo, no X-rays then?” Almudena flashed a devilish smile at Deandre, “And here I was worrying about you gawking at me.”<br><br>She puffed out her chest, making it obvious what she’d been implying. Fortunately for Deandre, Garth’s light show kicked in at just the right moment to pull her focus off of him and let the flustered youth regroup... At least until the fragile Power collapsed in a horrible coughing fit.<br><br>“Amigo, soy de el peor neighborhood en el peor city en el peor country en mi half of the planet, eso que ni qué,” Almudena’s jovial tone remained, but she no longer made an attempt to meet Deandre’s gaze.<br><br>“El Archipiélago... It’s not that different, except that people have chingo dineros here. Back ‘home’ in the past year, I had dos matóns jump me with baseball bats for my lunch money, un tonto try to knife me and take my phone, and-” Almudena shrugged, “I went to a Catholic school, muy traditionale.

I'm just saying that some of us come from a lot worse than this."<br><br>It was then that Nessa joined them. Almudena paused at the newcomer's accent; she'd had quite a bit of experience with Americanos, but the new girl's lilting threw her off. She waited for Deandre to field the question for her for all of the half a second it took her to realize he'd do nothing of the sort.<br><br>"¿Que onda? Nada mayor," Almudena offered. She quickly pointed around the room, first to Garth, who Ben was tending to, "Furball". Then to Ben himself, "Fresa". Then, tracking Flint who was maniacally skating around the room, "Okay, I haven't nicknamed that güey."<br><br>She shifted in her seat, turning to face Nessa. Prodding at Deandre, she noted, "El Literato,", and put a palm on her own chest, "Alma."<br><br>Almudena heard a sigh of relief from the younger girls. Flashing her best impression of the iconic trollface, she jerked her thumb towards Dalisay, "Dallas."<br><br>The little girl in overalls impotently stomped her foot, and dashed her pencil to the floor.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Another messy cough sounded in the auditorium from Garth drawing Belwyn's attention. She had seen a bit of what transpired after his demonstration once she came out of her hiding spot, but she had assumed the other teacher was handling it. Not wanting to give the young man more unwanted than attention than he already had, she kept her place and soon had been caught up on Flint's presentation. Looking over at Garth now, however, his condition hadn't seemed to improve very much. Her eyebrows drew together in growing concern as he coughed again, this time going even paler than his already paper white skin. <br><br>Scooting her chair away from the table as quietly as possible, Belwyn slipped out and down to the floor. Walking lightly next to the wall, as not to disturb the proceedings, she made her way to Garth as the next student was called. It looked like he was taking his time preparing something in the back, so maybe she could make it to her destination before -<br><br>Belwyn suddenly found herself sitting on the floor just feet from the students. The confusion was stronger than the pain and she just sat there for a moment with blinking eyes trying to figure what exactly had happened. She didn't have to wonder for long, however, when one of the teachings on stage had the very same question. In hindsight, she really wished she had looked at the staff files a bit more. She wasn't sure she could even remember half of people sitting in the front.<br><br>“What did you do?” The man with spiky brown hair asked curiously.<br><br>"I made the floor frictionless in a couple spots," The boy replied with a shrug. Aodhan gave the older boy an approving grin. She arched an eyebrow and shook her head at the exchange.<br><br>If the teacher hadn't said anything Belwyn probably would have just assume she had slipped on a stray piece of ice from Flint's demonstration. It wouldn't be the first time, unfortunately. Nor would it be even close to the last. <br><br>Sliding forward a few inches, she found purchase on more stable ground. There was little chance her fall went unnoticed this time. With a resigned sigh she brushed down her dress and finished her walk to the struggling Garth.  One of the teachers was still there lending his assistance as he could. Belwyn gathered her courage and tapped him on the shoulder first. <br><br>“Hello,” she gave a small wave, “I'm sorry I've forgotten your name, Sir. I'm Belwyn Truid, the school's nurse. Perhaps I could be of help here.” She gave the man a friendly smile and then bent down so she could be eye level with Garth as he sat in his chair. <br><br>“Hello to you as well, Garth.” She said in a softer tone, smile still in place. The last thing anyone wanted when they were sick was loud noises. Something she knew about all too well. <br><br>“I'm Miss Truid or Miss Belwyn if you prefer.” She continued, “I'm going to see if I can't help you get a bit better. Is that alright with you?” She extended her hand to his and waited expectantly.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SV</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Seeing that the excitement had died down sufficiently, Thyra resumed her place at the fore of the stage to commence with the demonstrations. "Mica Howard," she called across the gymnasium.<br><br>The girl, still slightly on edge from what had just transpired, straightened in her seat with a startled "Oh." She slid out of the desk, grabbed her backpack, and headed toward the stage.<br><br>The contents of her bag clinked softly as she climbed the stairs to the stage. Mica crossed to the table where the gadgets provided for Carlos' demonstration still lay, untouched. She stacked them neatly together and placed them on a nearby chair, and then hefted her backpack from her shoulder.<br><br>It hit the table with a <i>thud</i> -- it was evidently heavier than it looked --  and more clinking. The girl began to unzip the bag but faltered a little, casting her eyes toward the superintendent. "This isn't going to be that flashy," she said quietly, her tone a little apologetic. But Thyra just gave a slight nod, to reassure her, and Mica turned her attention back to the contents of her backpack.<br><br>Fully unzipping it, she reached inside and drew forth a small collection of mason jars, each filled with different colors of what appeared to be sand. These she lined carefully on one side of the table. Pausing for a moment in consideration, she selected a jar full of brilliant leafy-green sand, unscrewed the lid, and dumped its contents out over the surface of the table. She repeated the process with each of the other jars until she was left with a sizeable, multicolored mound before her. <br><br>The young geomancer took a deep breath, furrowed her brow in concentration, and waved her hand deliberately over the heap. <br><br>And the sand began to move. <br><br>A ribbon of golden sand snaked its way up from the mound, thin at first, but growing in substance. After a moment, a second strand arose, this one a rich brown, followed by deep ochre and lavender, turquoise and finally the green. The rivulets of sand twined around one another as they rose lazily upward until, about a foot above the table, they started swirling together. Mica squinted her eyes together as the vortex gathered speed, a blur of indeterminate color that bowed outward into a sphere before collapsing into a disk.<br><br>The mass of spinning sand slowed, and then stopped.<br><br>When Mica opened her eyes, there was a simple mandala hanging in the air before her, its colors trembling a little under her exertion to hold the shape together, shedding granules of sand back onto the table top below. The geomancer cracked a toothy smile and let the mass collapse, different colors streaming back into their separate jars. She swept the remnants onto the ground and loaded her jars back into her bag, still beaming.<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Slightly in a daze, Deandre did his best to follow along with the Catholic schoolgirl's rapid-fire Spanish. He'd taken a couple of years in middle school, but in conversation he'd never been as strong as in reading and writing. It was strange how readily the spoken word vanished out of memory... But he understood the gist of the harsh upbringing she was describing. He nodded in sympathy, curling his lip, but trying not to look at her too much. The girl had an intense penchant for eye contact. To hold her confident gaze and return it was beyond the realm of boys like him. Whatever bruises her troubles from "<i>los pingüinos</i>" had left on the mocha-colored girl, they'd also made her stronger than Deandre could hope to be.<br><br>He might have been on the verge of telling her something that would've awkwardly approximated the shape of that thought, if the Scottish girl with the green tunic and startlingly red hair hadn't dropped in at that moment. As the Latina girl pointed out various students by her own self-appointed nicknames (including one for Deandre with which he took no issue), he finally caught her naming herself. Alma? He hastily flipped back several pages to add this to her entry, while mumbling a distracted "Hello" at the newcomer. Then, thinking better of that, he added: "I'm Deandre. Nice to meet you... Everyone's just introducing themselves, up there." It occurred to him that with the Scottish girl's arrival, at least one student hadn't watched his own miserable appearance. That brightened his attitude at least a little bit as he pointed to the very young girl onstage who was now pouring sand out of jars onto a table.<br><br>Then what the young girl did next - Mica, if he'd heard right - put all thoughts of self-reproach out of his mind. The girl wove her hands over the heap of sand, and one by one, each color wove its way back out of the heap, twisting and curling in the air, a kaleidoscope of russet and jade and periwinkle that knitted itself into a beautifully intricate Tibetan-like mandala. He'd seen one much like it before. That'd been in the same room where the monstrous chairs had hung.<br><br>Deandre blinked, puzzled by this last thought. Then, as so often when such a thing crossed his mind, he questioned it no more, but laid pen to paper and let it speak.<br><br>GALLERY WING. MONKS VISITED, DREW MANDALA THERE ONCE.

He couldn't picture the mandala that the monks had spent several weeks meticulously tracing in the same gallery, but he knew it was the same place as surely as he knew anything. Though unable to send the gruesome chairs out of his mind's eye, he clapped along with the rest for Mica's lovely demonstration. There was so much beauty the other students were capable of creating... and then Deandre, who could put nothing creative into the world with his power. Though, neither could his power be destructive - it was the unyielding zero-sum - and wasn't that more than could be said of Alma and her detonating punches...?<br><br>Alma didn't <i>need</i> to create beauty, el Literato thought rather defiantly, and turned the page.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler5657779').toggle();if($('#spoiler5657779').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler5657779"><i>The series of armchair drawings is an actual work of art named <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://radioopensource.org/armed-chair-bill-flynns-seat-of-empire/">"Armed Chair" by Bill Flynn</a>.

Though he knew that Thyra was under an immense amount of stress with the opening of the school, Marius couldn't help but feel like he was being made into a scapegoat. Being a military leader, Marius understood this with crystal clarity. Thyra had to exert her dominance over her staff or risk being eaten alive by them. Marius was built tough and he weathered Thyras tirade with the grace expected of a Drakengrad noble. His face was a mask of slight regret but didn't give any more of an impression than that. <br> <br><i>Remember what Lord Lorsha told you</i>. <br> <br>Marius could remember clearly the day Valon asked him to accept the post at Terminer Academy. Valon had summoned Marius to his personal study deep with the palace and sat with him at a long oak table before a fire the size of most living spaces. Valon sat with the letter from Thyra before him and regarded Marius for a long moment before speaking. Marius hated when he did that, take long pauses for dramatic effect, it seemed like more of a trait you'd find in an actor instead of a king. <br> <br>"Marius, a very dear friend of mine has asked for you to take up a post at a new academy she's overseeing. It would seem that it will be a place for young powers to train in a safe environment in the hopes to put an end to the constant conflicts we seem to get tied into. Her cause is noble but flawed, though I can't fault her for trying.  She's not a warrior like us, Marius, but she has a good heart and a level head.  I'd like you to accept this post at the school and do whatever it is that she asks of you.  You'll report to Lady Thyra Russell tomorrow as soon as you're ready. One thing that I will ask of you, Marius, is to prepare these children for what the world is really like.  Thyras plan is sound, but if the children aren't made to know what the world is really like they will end up either dead or in the hands of something dark. I can't allow that to happen, and neither can you. Will you do that for me?" <br> <br><i>Yes master, I'll make them see the world for what it truly is.</i> <br> <br>Marius closed his eyes for a moment and focused his mind a much as he could. What he was about to do would be quite hard, his pride would be wounded at the very least but I had to be done. Just as Marius was about to speak, Silumas piped up and began requesting special access to a pair of students. A white hot rage sprang to life deep with Marius' chest and a hand went deep into his sleeve to the hilt of a hidden dagger. Why would this being be demanding special access to the students if not for some nefarious plan. Biting back a quick reply, Marius allowed his ice-cold calm to settle back over him. It took through the entirety of the next two demonstrations but once it was in place he trusted himself to speak once again. <br> <br>"Lady Thyra, I apologize for my actions. They will never happen again, you have my word. Please allow this event to be left in the past," Marius stated just loud enough for the staff to hear before turning his attention to Silumas.  Marius slipped into a long dead language that he and Valon would speak in to discuss matters when untrustworthy ears were near, a language he was sure that no one other than maybe Silumas would speak or at least understand. <br> <br><b>{You'll find that you'd do well to leave the punishment of the students to me, as is my job.

I'm sorry, but I didn't follow much of what you said. I failed all the Spanish me mum made me take in school.

Nessa rested her cheek in her right hand and watched with a bemused smile on her face. There was something about the swirling colored grains that was instantly calming and Nessa enjoyed every second of the display. Once Mica was done Nessa clapped nearly as loud as Alma and added a piercing, musical whistle to the mix. <br> <br>"Do you all have power like that?"</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">With all the drama surrounding Garth after his demonstration and the sudden freezing of the floor and erupting ice pillars brought about by the boy who was skating around the room, Talia had almost completely missed what Carlos had done, other than noticing a change in the molecular vibrations of certain spots on the floor, as well as whatever Mica was doing on stage up until a massive column of colored sand rose into the air and formed a beautiful mandala in the air.<br><br>“Next up, Talia Kane.”  Thyra announced.<br><br>Upon hearing her name Talia was slightly hesitant, taking a deep breath before sliding out of her desk and standing.  She held her heavy, hardback book under her right arm and started walking swiftly towards the front of the auditorium.  As she reached the center of the stage she slowed, noting that the empty drinking glass and small, red brick she had asked for were resting on the edge of the stage.  She was very apprehensive about demonstrating her powers as it had been quite awhile since she had actually tried to use the greater portion of them on purpose and her control was often fickle at best.<br><br>Taking another deep breath she placed her book on the edge of the stage and then returned to the center and faced the student body.  She was hesitant again and glanced back at the teachers, mainly Thyra, with an apprehensive expression suggesting she didn’t think this was a good idea.  Upon receiving a slight nod from her, however, Talia took a deep breath and carried on. <br><br>“Talia Kane here”, she said with a slight nod to the student body.  “My power is the sensation and manipulation of vibrations”, she deliberately left out the part pertaining to sound waves for fear that might ‘foster mistrust’ as Thyra had said earlier.  “My interests are mostly science related and i’m pretty good with math.”<br><br>After saying her piece she took yet another deep breath as she began to clear her mind and she kicked her sandals off to one side, placing her bare feet upon the floor.  She was now able to fully sense all of the vibrations in the floor of the stage, the floor of the auditorium and even the vibrations in the ground beneath the building down to a certain depth.  It was sometimes too much to be able to sense everything going on beneath her feet and the sandals provided her with a good balance.  She could sense enough to be aware of what was going on atop the ground around her, but not so much that she could tune into what was happening below ground.  This was not to say that tuning into everything occurring below ground was overwhelming, but at times it was very distracting because she could easily become lost in it.<br><br>As she closed her eyes she began to focus on all of the vibrations emanating from objects and people in the auditorium.  She focused on all of the empty desks in the auditorium and focused vibratory waves from the floor up through their metal legs.  The desks began to shudder slightly and then vibrate audibly against the floor.  Talia reached out her hands slightly, her elbows remaining at her sides and her palms faced the floor.  One could almost swear that the air beneath her palms seemed to visibly shudder.  The vibrating of the desks continued as Talia now began to focus other vibratory waves from the floor up into the bleachers, causing them to begin shuddering, giving the students there quite a stir.  Talia smiled slightly as the vibrating of the desks and bleachers slowly became an audible roar that echoed through the auditorium.  <i>Not doing too badly</i> she thought to herself.<br><br>But suddenly the entire building seemed to shudder audibly and Talia opened her eyes seeming surprised and looked around to see what the matter was.  Talia gasped as the building gave another audible shudder and she watched in horror as cracks began to form along the walls, spreading slowly, many of the teachers and students quickly getting to their feet.  <i>But I...no no no, not again!</i>  Desperation suddenly filled her eyes as she began trying to rein her powers back in, only then realizing that her control had slipped.  <i>Why didn’t I feel it?  I always feel it when it slips!</i>  She began pulling all of the vibratory force that was assaulting the building to her and focusing it on the air around her.  Suddenly the very ground beneath the building rumbled and she could see terror filling the students in the auditorium and the lights flickered as circuits were interrupted by the shaking.<br><br>Talia took a deep breath, things weren’t completely out of her control yet, but they would be soon if she didn’t get a handle on her powers quickly.  Shuddering streams of vibratory force seemed to pulse through the air between her and building as she pulled all of it to herself and away from the building.  The very air around her seemed to shudder violently and began to pulse outward, growing in strength.  She glanced at the brick and the empty drinking glass she had asked Thyra for and while they had been intended for another purpose they were ironically just what she needed to stop this from becoming a nightmare.  She used some of the extreme vibratory force around her to literally levitate the two items into the air, vibratory forces shuddering beneath them.  She drew the empty drinking glass in front of her at eye level so she could focus on it and pushed the small, red brick farther into the air out in front of her.  The stage rumbled violently as she held all of the vibratory force she had accidently built up in a focused shell around herself that pulsed strongly now, enough to whip up bursts of wind that forced the faculty on stage to shield themselves.  Because her control had slipped there was now far too much vibratory force built up under her control for her to simply absorb.  Simply releasing it, however, was not an option either because the resulting blast, while not as catastrophic as if she had been angry, would still be extremely powerful.  She had no choice, but to wait until the force balanced itself out to a refined state and then she could focus it into an object, causing a mild shock wave by comparison.  But could she control it for long enough to achieve this, was her primary concern.<br><br>She continued to take slow deep breaths and focused her mind.  Slowly the shuddering shell of vibrations around her began to stabilize until the stage stopped rumbling, she was in control of it, for the moment.  Wasting no time she began to funnel the shell of vibratory force into the small, red brick that was still levitating high in the air out in front of her.  The vibratory force holding the drinking glass in the air would be the last to go, sending it plummeting to the floor and so it would serve as a sort of trigger for her.  As the air around the brick slowly stopped shuddering, tiny microfractures formed throughout its structure.  Talia had her eyes shut tightly and seemed to be struggling, her face dripping with sweat as she tried to hold onto the sheer amount of force under her control.  Her hands began to tremble and then finally the drinking glass dropped from the air and shattered upon the stage.  At that she coalesced all of the force into a single point within the brick and held it for a split second and then let go.  She fell to her knees and there was the tiniest of delays before the brick simply exploded into a cloud of fine, red dust.  The resulting shockwave was nearly deafening as it rattled the building to its foundation, the lights flickering and the massive sea view window above shattering and raining glass down upon anyone unfortunate enough to be directly below.<br><br>All eyes were on her, some likely exhibiting sheer terror,  and she watched as the cloud of red dust rained down before her.  A slight gasp escaped her, her eyes growing wide with terror as the enraged scream of her fourteen year old self rattled through her mind.  The cloud of red dust raining down upon the front of the auditorium had triggered a flashback of the deeply buried memory of her father’s death.  She remembered in horror as her powers, out of control, unleashed a blast even more powerful than this and vaporized her father.  The horror continued as the red mist that was once her father coated the walls of their living room and rained down on the furniture and floor, just as the red brick dust did before her in this moment.<br><br>The flashback raked over her mind and she choked back a sob.  She was dangerous and she was a murderer and nothing had changed.  As hard as she had tried to reign in her powers over the years she had only become more dangerous.  Talia quickly got to her feet, burying her face in her hands as she fled from the front of the auditorium, sobbing uncontrollably, and ran out into the hallway towards the restrooms she had seen when she first arrived.<br><br>This was her nightmare.  No matter where she went, she was still a danger to everyone around her and this incident was nothing compared to if she ever got angry.  This time she had been able to avoid a complete overload, but with her powers still growing in strength and her control not leveling equally she was convinced it was only a matter of time before she lost any ability to control her powers at all.  <br><br>Worse yet, never before had her control slipped without her immediately being aware of it in her mind.  Something new had just gone horribly wrong.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler207932').toggle();if($('#spoiler207932').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler207932"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="349" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MlVha12BGf0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1"></iframe><br><i>Pictured: Talia.

He'd missed this one's name when Alma had introduced her. She was young enough that he couldn't be sure the incoming question was going to be quite tactful, but Deandre knew quite well from his days in Georgia that there was only one polite answer to "Can I ask you something?". "Sure, miss...?" he replied. "I didn't catch your name, I'm sorry."<br><br>Almost reflexively, however, he turned his eyes back down to his book as the Scottish girl, Nessa, asked her question. He'd left a vague and noncommittal smile on his face. It seemed like the kind of question better left to Alma.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Silumas</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><i>It appears I am rapidly making friends…<br></i><br>Silumas calmly waited for Marius to finish his tirade while markedly ignoring Killik altogether. The Magus didn’t tremble with anger or quiver in fear, he neither raised a hand to strike at the man or prepare to defend himself. Instead he held the visage of an adult being threatened by a prepubescent whelp, a gentle smile on his face and his deep eyes blinking lazily. When the young man had finished blathering on, Silumas responded in English so the rest of the faculty could hear, including Thyra.<br><br>“You are at least interesting,” said Silumas, “that is a language I have not heard, or at least I do not remember it. It must be insignificant and hold little real value.”<br><br>He took a measured step towards Marius, “Threats, you will find, hold little meaning to me. Just as a fly holds no real threatening value to you. I will give you this: you appear to be a well-trained warrior with years of experience. You know how to take the measure of an enemy to know when to fight, when to hold firm, and when to run. I am an enemy you cannot begin to measure. I could snuff you out with but a thought, and a couple more thoughts and I would have you wiped from existence as if you had never been. As Thyra warned you, none of you have the ability to stop me from being as I wish to be, from doing what it is I wish to do. Rely on your experience and your training to tell you what your mouth appears not to know: I am not to be trifled with. Unlike our colleague, Killik, I hold some amount of respect for what, at least relative to your world, amounts to an honorable, storied history.”<br><br>“For him,” Silumas gestured towards Killik, “I believe your world has a saying: those who cannot do, teach. And those who cannot teach, teach gym. Did I state that correctly?”<br><br>“It is also confusion to me how the rest of the faculty here seems to confuse discipline with punishment. Discipline is something that is taught to a person to better them, while punishment is something you do to someone for behavior you find inappropriate. One teaches...the other is just fun,” Silumas finished the sentence and it was truly difficult to tell whether he was being serious or not.<br><br>Towards the end of his monologue, Talia had been finishing her demonstration and he saw her begin to lose her control over the power she possessed. Subtly, he reinforced the infrastructure of the building with Earth and Death, bracing the steel and concrete and quickly repairing cracks as they formed. It may not have been necessary, but no need to risk lives this early in the semester. He did not make any overt gestures to calm or reassure anyone, including Talia, yet those that could sense Power could feel trickles of it flowing from the Magus and into the surrounding structure.<br><br>When she had finished regaining some amount of control over herself, the young Talia fled the auditorium and ran away. It took little effort for Silumas to track her movements. All life exhibit some amount of mana radiation, sentient beings even moreso. When she had arrived in the bathroom, Talia had turned on the sink and begun to wash the tears from her face.<br><br>The lights in the restroom were bright and warm, designed to provide a feeling of safety and comfort. Apparently, the architects and designers of the school expected something similar to this situation. It was comfortable enough, that it took Talia a couple of moments to realize her’s was not the only reflection in the mirror. The robed visage of Silumas appeared in the mirror, but a quick check over the shoulder would reveal he had not actually come into the room. His face was stern, but somehow gentle at the same time. <br><br>“Talia Kane, interesting display,” the Visage spoke softly, with hints of warmth and perhaps even compliment. “Your abilities are powerful, there is no doubt about that. You are also dangerous, there is just as little doubt about that. Here, however, you need have no doubt that you, and those around you, are safe. While you are powerful, I am dozens of orders of magnitude (you said you liked algebra) moreso. Anything you can do, I can protect and defend against, both for you and those you fear to harm. That is the reason this place even exists, young Talia. This school was designed with someone just like you in mind. You could hurt others until you learn control over yourself, over your powers. We, and the rest of the staff, will teach you that control. To even begin that process we needed a place where you can make mistakes without fear of destroying everything, and everyone, around you. This is that place, Talia. Here, you are safe. In this school you are safe. With me you are safe. Stay, learn, and discipline yourself, and all places will become safe for you and those you care about. When you have regained your composure, I hope you will rejoin the other students and watch the remaining demonstrations. I think you will find mine as interesting as I found yours.”<br><br>During his second monologue in as many minutes, Silumas had remained physically in the auditorium, responding to conversation and speaking as if part of his mind and power were not somewhere else. He had given Marius the slightest of nods to indicate he was done with their conversation. <br><br>A silent thought passed from himself to Killik, “As a true Professor at this school, I am sure you will understand that my schedule will be quite full…” There was a pause and despite this being a purely mental communication, there could still be heard the smirk in Silumas’ voice, “Coach. I will attempt to make some time for you, though.”<br><br>The Visage of Silumas slowly faded out of existence, and the mirror returned to showing the rest of the bathroom and Talia alone. When Talia would return to the auditorium, if she would, and might happen to glance in Silumas’ direction she would find the Elementalist sternly watching the current student or faculty displaying their abilities. Yet, he would glance her way for just the smallest moment and give the briefest of nods in encouragement, before returning his attention to the demonstration.<br><br><i>Making friends indeed...<br></i><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"It's..." Dalisay shot a furtive glance over to Almudena, who was currently talking with the redheaded newcomer. She leaned in, her pigtails rustling, and spoke in the best whisper should could manage.<br><br>"My name's Dalisay. Dalisay Salazar," She steadied herself by placing her hands on the crossbar of the desk, and took a deep breath, her cheeks reddening.<br><br>"Mister Deandre," She croaked, keeping her voice low as possible, averting her eyes in shame, "Do you hate your powers, too?"<br><br>When Deandre didn't respond instantly, she kept going, keeping her voice low so that the other girls wouldn't hear her.<br><br>"I feel like everything around me gets ruined.

But I've heard some of the other students saying they can go home at night, and-" She went silent, biting her lip. The girl inhaled and exhaled choppily, trying to stifle her sniffling. She wiped her nose on her arm, and quickly rubbed away her tears with the palms of her hands.<br>----<br>"No, we've Powers todos los tipos, chica," Almudena offered with another one of her shining grins, "You missed Furball over there almost blowing up the earth with a giant cometa, and la zorra on the bleachers did a light-show.

Watching her close her eyes and concentrate, Flint felt small tremors in the earth below. As the vibrations grew in strength the building began to shake. Small cracks appeared in the walls but began to reseal shortly after they appeared. He could feel pulses emanating from the structure creating pressure on his skin.  Tiny grey slivers began to spread through his eyes as the building began to shake more violently. The girl no longer looked nervous, now she seemed panicked. This was obviously not her intended presentation. Frost formed on Flint’s eye lashes as the temperature around his body began to plummet. As the temperature decreased the vibrations nearby began to slow until they no longer seemed to move at all. <br><br>Some of the younger students seemed frightened as Talia’s control slipped further.  The grey slivers began to grow larger and Flint took deep breaths; her control wasn’t the only one that was slipping. Time passed slowly and the building began to settle. Her powers seemed more controlled now but her look of panic had only grown. Raising a hand Flint covered his right eyes as the last portion of blue gave way to gray, only the left eye still held traces of the original vibrant color. Powder covered the room as a brick exploded on the stage followed by Talia quickly exiting the room. Standing up, Flint quietly walked out of the room after her. He had seen that type of panicked look before. It wasn’t just the look of someone who feared losing control; it was the look of someone who had lost something due to that lack of control. Sitting in the hallway he took deep breaths and some of the grey began to recede.<br><br>“I will just have to wait for her to come back.” <br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Do you hate your powers, too?", and there had to be that one vanishing instant of relief before the full weight of her words sank in.<br><br>He hated that feeling of relief, now that it had gone. The relief at - what? That she hadn't asked the "tactless" question? She hadn't demanded "So when are you gonna tell us what it is, huh?" Oh, no, she'd only seen in him someone she could open up to, that was all, and here Deandre had been too self-centered to realize that. He'd had to second-guess the tiny girl who was now quietly choking up and sniffling at his side. Not knowing what else to do, he reached out and laid a hand on her arm. "I'm sorry," he told her softly, understanding at least that she meant to keep the conversation private. "I'm really sorry... Maybe they can help you here, maybe--"<br><br>"Next up, Talia Kane."<br><br>Dalisay wiped her eyes and looked toward the stage, and Deandre followed suit, not making any attempt to finish his sentence, but also keeping a hand on her arm. With the other hand, he dutifully recorded as Talia, the similarly bookish girl with the dark-blond hair he'd noticed early on, introduced her power as "the sensation and manipulation of vibrations". While she took off her sandals and held still, eyes closed, Deandre had enough time to ponder what he would have said if pressed to answer Dalisay's question: <i>Did</i> he hate his power?<br><br>Well, hadn't his parents seemed a little excited to see him off, too? Only Deandre had grown more careful in the last five or six years; had learned, from his family, his schools, his church, the consequences of using his power on people he knew - or even letting them know it was possible. But it was a privilege to even have that choice. Before then, when he had been Dalisay's age, he'd been like her, with no control over the ability at all. Still... had he really hated it then? Hadn't he <i>loved</i> it then, better than he ever could now?<br><br>The desks were vibrating. Deandre took back his hand and put down the pen to grasp his desk on both sides, feeling the tremors running up and down the metal legs and over the surface. Talia was standing with her arms slightly raised, palms down, her tranquil smile at odds with the clamor of shaking metal that grew louder and louder by the second. Deandre glanced back to Dalisay only to see that the Asian girl had ducked under her chair and out of sight again - well, that much was predictable enough. Alma, on the other hand, had lifted her feet off the ground and stretched out her arms, laughing tremulously as her chair and everything in it shook up and down. An exuberant cry was the only thing to tell him Nessa was similarly enjoying herself, since her face had vanished beneath the swishing crop of red hair.<br><br>Deandre was close to admitting that he was having fun, too, until a massive groan sounded all around them. The walls were starting to crack.<br><br>He leapt out of his seat, which was now rocking furiously in place; the book flew open, pages fluttering madly; the pen rattled off the edge and bounced away. All around him, other students were jumping to their feet as well, and screams and cries filled the auditorium. As the floor lurched and the lights flickered, Deandre seized the desk above Dalisay's head and tried - not quite successfully - to hold it still for protection over the wailing, curled-up girl. His knees were rocking, and only the sudden swell of sickness in his stomach held him back from letting out a terrified shout. When he shot a glance at Talia, it was to see the blond girl levitating a glass of water and a single red brick in front of her. Though Deandre couldn't understand the meaning of this, her look appeared purposeful as much as frightened. Then the vibrations subsided - or rather, she seemed to have concentrated them into a single target. In the same moment that she dropped the glass of water to shatter on the floor, Talia fell to her knees, and the brick exploded into red dust. The room settled into stillness once again.<br><br>Before anyone could speak, Talia had pulled herself to her feet and fled the auditorium in tears. The next to mount the stage was CANDIDATE NUMBER ONE, with a flap of his cape, who waved a hand to refurbish the cracked walls. Deandre relaxed, and sank back into his seat, giving an attempt at a reassuring smile when Dalisay poked her head back up. And then he noticed the thought, very much his own, that snuck in at the sight of Dalisay:<br><br><i>Well,</i> Talia's <i>another one who hates her power, anyway.</i><br><br>What kind of thing to think was that?<br><br>And why, come to that, had he reacted so differently between Garth's demonstration and Talia's? Garth, by his own admission, had come close to inviting a meteor directly into the auditorium and Deandre had thought it was a wonder. Talia had lost control, had nearly brought the place crashing down, and that had appalled him. What was so different about them? What did it come down to except that Deandre had already met Garth before he stepped up onstage? There had been a built-in level of trust there, automatically, without even any intent. And with Talia, that trust had been absent. And <i>that</i> thought was the last stop pointing Deandre toward his own hypocrisy, because it was that same prospect of being feared by his classmates that had kept him from reaching out to them, and then he had become exactly the terrified onlooker to Talia he had been dreading for himself... He'd have to find her later, to talk with her about this, and let it be known that he didn't want to treat her like an outcast.<br><br>He'd also have to write this down.<br><br>Where was his pen?<br><br>It was the only pen he'd had on his person. The rest of them were in his room with the rest of the baggage. No. Damn it. <i>No.</i> Where was it? Deandre pitched onto the floor and crawled on his hands and knees among the desks, breathing heavily, feeling around in the unsteady light.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">If there was one thing Emma Ray Jo knew how to do, and she knew it sure as chickens have a hankering for spaghetti, it was how to take cover when the building you were in decided to up and collapse.

The other Brightfeldian had staggered weakly to his feet, and had enscribed another circle of vibrant flame in the air above him, the buff guy, and the dark haired lady. It wasn’t as immense as his first one, this one more like an umbrella furnished from the void of space.<br><br>The high-falutin’ superintendent lady, the one her ma and pa had told her to keep an eye out for, had shot across the room like she’d been fired out of a cannon. She twisted in midair, a catlike motion that turned her to face back towards the stage. She hit the bleachers feetfirst with a bang like a thunderclap, the blow hard enough that the collapsable benches slid a tier closer to the wall, bowling several of the teens off their feet. She threw her arms out to either side, in what looked like a gesture of defiance, until a translucent force unfurled from her arms like a time-lapse of a flower blooming. It encircled the five of them, bubbling them off from the rest of the ruckus.<br><br>“AGUAS!” A pair of leather shoes quickly trotted across her field of vision- The Mexican girl had gotten up, and had chucked the other elementary schooler, the one named Michael or something like that (it sounded like her pa’s name) straight under the desk beside her. The teen didn’t stop there, she hoisted the twins by their clutched hands, and jammed the two of them halfway under another desk. Almudena brought her fist down on an unoccupied desk, the sledgehammer blow popping it into the air like a buttermilk flapjack. She caught it in midair and dropped it upside over most of what was left exposed on the twins.<br><br>Emma heard a remark from the energetic girl, Jessie, she was pretty sure.<br><br>“Guys, it’s okay!

Seeing the stage shake and threaten to crumble like that, something he probably could have done without the tension that filled the air, he was rapidly approaching his limit.

What had she said her power was, something about vibrations. He hummed in agreement as he absorbed what he'd just witnessed. The girl clearly had some control issues and it sent a shiver through him. If she had been whispering in their ears and had lost control in that instant, what would have happened? Burst eardrum? Deafness? Worse?<br><br>"Ben Lexann," the superintendent shouted as she climbed down the stage <i>and where is she going in the middle of all this</i>.<br><br>The boy in blue and gold stepped up to the stage and Carlos took the opportunity to study his face properly, angular in the right places, strong jawline.

He couldn't wrap his head around why his gut was squirming like that <i>he isn't even looking in this direction</i> and he couldn't figure out if he should be scared or not. He glanced at his friends and none of them had reacted with anything other than mild interest and the boy. Willing himself to calm down <i>this should not be a flight-or-fight moment</i> he tried to focus in on what the boy on the stage looked like, what he was saying.<br><br>"My name's Ben Lexann, I was averaging a three-point-two-five at my old school," he said, his voice was confident and even and exactly what Carlos expected. It suited his appearance, after all. Even though he was wearing a loose-fitting jersey shirt <i>it isn't just the lining, it's in the stitching, that's cool</i> he was wearing loose-fitting clothing that kind-of accentuated his body. Sort of like what Evelyn was wearing, but not tailor-cut to his body. It was a good look. "I was on the football, basketball and soccer teams at my old school and my power is... Well, I can shapeshift. Kinda."<br><br>There was a pause, everyone was waiting for some kind of explanation <i>'kinda' doesn't really narrow it down there</i> and Ben actually looked sheepish for a second, which was weird in itself. He looked a bit like he didn't actually want to show off his power, but now that Carlos was examining his expression again, it was different. Like he was hesitating or torn between not wanting to and a bit like he did want to. It was confusing. Carlos was confused.<br><br>"I can't change into just anything, it's like... I can turn into one other shape? It's an animal, I call it a beast."<br><br>Carlos' blood ran like ice as soon as he heard the word beast and suddenly he wasn't curious about Ben's power any more, he wanted to be literally anywhere but the auditorium right now <i>is he gonna shift what's he gonna do oh shit oh shit</i> and his mind was going a million miles a minute and he could feel his breath catching, stuttering in his chest. Ben was taking his shirt off on the stage and Carlos might have taken the moment to appreciate his physique if he wasn't <i>freaking the fuck out</i>, he could see Ben's mouth turning into a snout and there's fur sprouting all over and there's darkness flooding his vision <i>there's teeth his teeth oh fuck</i> and<br><br><i>He's pinned to the ground, he's said the wrong thing again even though he doesn't know what he's said, maybe his mother's just feeling vindictive but at this point it doesn't matter.

He looks closer and sees strands of skin still attached, where the dog had tried chewing, he guessed, and his stomach turns.

His mother still hasn't returned to the room. If she had, she probably would have told him to clean up the mess and that's exactly what he wants to do, wants to shower and scrub away the blood and drool and dirty feeling that's covering him, smothering him. He makes his way to the bathroom and he can't hear either his mother or the dog anywhere, normally he'd hear them shuffling around. The house is eerily quiet.<br><br>The spray from the shower is scalding and that's how he needs it, needs to burn some sensation into his skin, to burn away the feel of the dog and its weight on his chest. His neck stings, really fucking <b>stings</b>, under the water but he can't stand the blood, can't stand how it's clinging to his skin, it's like the dog's jaws are there again. There's no way he can leave the house now, no way would he be able to explain away these cuts and he doesn't think he owns anything with a high enough neck to cover them. The water runs red down the drain, then pink, then finally it's clear and Carlos can feel his breathing settling</i><br><br><div style="text-align:right;">Carlos can feel his breathing settling.</div><br><br>He blinked a couple of times, his vision slowly coming back with each second. He felt his arms, pulled out to either side, still being gripped firmly. Someone was pressed up against his back, their knees on either side of his hips. In front of him, Jay and Evelyn and Mel were all wearing matching expressions, somewhere between concern and panic, all tense and for a second he couldn't understand, his head was rattling and buzzing and he could feel adrenaline surging through his body, or maybe it was flushing out of his system. It was nearly silent, completely still except for the sound of his own breaths and that's what he focused on. <i>In, out, in, out</i> he felt that awful constricting, crippling sensation in his chest slowly ease with every breath. Whoever was behind him let go of his hands and he let his arms fall to his sides again, he wasn't ready to stand up yet, wasn't even really ready to sit up and he was leaning heavily backwards but hands were on his shoulders supporting him.<br><br>"Hey, Carlos, you with us man?" Jay said and his voice was softer than Carlos had ever heard it <i>that's weird stop doing that voice</i>, concern bleeding into the edges and Carlos nodded once, not trusting his voice yet. Whoever it was supporting him shifted and lifted him slightly so that he was leaning against one of the seats on the bleachers. "What happened?"<br><br>"Panic attack," someone supplied. Carlos looked and it was that guy he'd seen talking to the teacher, the one with the brown spiky hair and messenger bag. He was kneeling and that carefree look he'd had earlier was gone, it looked professional, even though he was wearing a vest and flip-flops and <i>why are you dressed for the beach if you're supposed to be a teacher</i> his eyes only briefly flickered from Carlos' face. All of the attention was on Carlos now and he really didn't appreciate it, he wanted to slink away somewhere quiet to get his head together. He couldn't believe he'd had a panic attack in front of an entire room of people.<br><br>"Do you have panic attacks often?" The teacher asked and his face flashed in Carlos' memory, he was listed in the info packs sent to all the students,<i> gym teacher what's his name, I know his name</i> and eventually his mind supplied Kilik Ginnungap. He looked weird without that good-natured, easygoing grin and Carlos only felt a bit like he'd stepped into the twilight zone, between his friends looking concerned and not hardened and Kilik's whole professional attitude that had come from nowhere. It wasn't a question he particularly wanted to answer <i>seriously I just want to be left alone</i> but he didn't see any way out of it.<br><br>"Not any more. I used to but I thought I'd outgrown them," he admitted, determinedly not looking anyone in the eye and he hated how shaky his voice sounded. The last thing he wanted was for his friends to start treating him like this fragile little boy, scared of breaking him just by touching him. Kilik seemed to accept that he probably wasn't going to get any more information based on the nod he gave, and Carlos just wanted him to go away.<br><br>"Do you need to leave the room? Get some fresh air?" The teacher offered. He didn't sound like he was taking pity and Carlos appreciated that, but shook his head. It was bad enough that he'd even had a panic attack, he didn't want to draw more attention by being the-kid-that-couldn't-even-sit-through-orientation <i>great first impression there, Carlos, really, A plus for effort</i> and it looked like Kilik got that because he nodded again and stood up. He gestured to the other teacher, the superintendent, and Carlos noticed some tension fade out of her posture as Kilik descended the bleachers again.<br><br>Now that the drama was over, everyone's eyes slowly stopped focusing off him and were back on the stage<i>. </i>Apart from Ben. He had only just noticed the brown-haired boy, definitely back in human shape now and not wearing a shirt, but Carlos saw his expression and it felt like a punch to the gut. It was like any emotion he was feeling just completely took over his face and it was weird, just like it was weird with Kilik, to see something that wasn't the easy, charming grin he'd had all morning so far. Now, it was a mask of concern and... <i>guilt</i>. It made his breath catch in his chest again, not like a panic attack, not nearly as bad, but his insides squirmed again, <i>no one's ever felt guilty about me,</i> if anything, he'd only ever seen someone looking at him with anger or disgust and it was so strange to have someone look at him as though...<br><br>He looked away but he could still feel Ben's eyes on him and he wished the other boy would look somewhere else.<br><br>"Are you sure you're alright man?" Jay asked and he was still using that weird voice. Carlos wasn't alright, not really, but he wasn't about to let that show any further.<br><br>"Jay, I'm fine, stop using that voice, you sound all kinds of wrong," he retorted, grateful that his voice had stopped faltering finally. He gave Jay a small shove and looked back at the stage.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia did not have to look over her shoulder to tell that the reflection of Silumas in the mirror was an illusion as her vibratory senses would have detected his approach well down the hallway.  She backed away from the mirror as he spoke, even though her senses detected no vibratory change in it and listened to his words from a slight distance up until his image faded away.  Her facial expression was no longer emotional, it was almost numb and empty after the evil man’s speech as she thought on his words.<br><br>Finally a defiant glare filled her eyes and a disgusted frown twisted across her face as she continued to stare into the mirror.  A high pitched burst of sound suddenly struck the mirror which promptly cracked and then shattered into the sink and onto the floor.  <i>The words of a ‘high and mighty’ man mean nothing to me.</i><br><br>She quickly turned and exited the restroom and was just about to turn and leave in the direction of the dorms when she noticed a white haired boy sitting in the hallway near the auditorium she had come from.  Flint, she recalled was the name Thyra had used when he was called up and he must have heard the restroom door open because he was now looking in her direction, but did not move.  He seemed to be breathing strangely and she noticed his molecular vibrations were currently extra bizarre compared to when she had first noticed him in the auditorium earlier.  It seemed she had not been the only one who had a reason to flee into the hallway and that at least comforted her a bit.<br><br>Talia sighed hard and sank to the floor against the wall and sat staring at the floor, deciding for the moment not to run any farther.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“You know, the fear, it only makes it worse.

I got pulled back, but it was at a huge price.” <br><br>The words fell from Flint’s lips among small clouds of frost. Only a few, rapidly disintegrating, grey slivers remained in his eyes. Staring blankly at the nearby wall he listened to Talia’s steady breathing. It was obvious that she had managed to find some semblance of psychological stability while in the bathroom. Glancing at the girl sitting down the hall, small circles of frost began circling Flint’s wrists. The icy particles orbiting the left wrist drifted into his right palm; slowly accumulating into a perfect sphere the size of an apple. The remaining ice particles drifted down the hallway forming a pile of similar spheres next to Talia. Tossing his snowball down the hallway Flint created another sphere in his palm. The projectile landed between the girl’s feet with a soft thump.<br><br>“It’s none of my business and I wouldn’t blame you for not answering, but I do have one question for you.”<br><br>Biting his lip, Flint seemed to be pondering if he should ask the question.<br><br>“Who did you see die?”<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia continued to stare at the floor silently despite her senses making her aware of the ice trail that formed down the hall towards her and the formation of the small spheres next to her.  She remained deep in thought, still hearing Flint’s words, but not responding to them.  Suddenly a snowball landed between her feet and she blinked, staring at it.  She focused on it, making its molecules vibrate to the point that it melted into a puddle on the floor.  She focused on vibrations in the floor and used them to push the puddle across the floor and down the hallway towards Flint.<br><br>“Maybe you’re right about the fear or maybe control just doesn’t come naturally to me, but either way I lost all control before I ever had a chance to try.  Before I even really understood what I could do, and it wasn’t because of fear.”  She said as she looked down the hall at the boy, her stare numb and blank.  “It was out of rage.”<br><br>Talia used a slight bit of vibratory force to levitate the other snow balls that had been piled up next to her out into the hallway in front of her and stacked them into snowmen.  She then used the slightest of vibrations to create indentations to serve as eyes, a nose and a mouth on each.<br><br>“My father was the one I saw die.”  She whispered, “but he wasn’t what I lost, he deserved it really.”<br><br>She sighed and leaned back against the wall and looked up at the ceiling.  “No, when I accidently killed him what I lost was a part of myself.  I was only 14, innocent.  I grew up to be a murderer that day.”<br><br>At that point she glanced down the hall at Flint, her face blank, “are you a murderer to Flint?”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“A murderer? I suppose you could say that. I’m guessing you saw that I was marking a history book earlier. You like books don’t you? Must have been painful to watch, but they are wrong you know. All that medieval history is about as honest as a guy that would use a holy statue to fight a monk. No one really wanted to admit how those wars were won. Monsters; monsters changed history and no one would admit it. Probably for the best. Doubt anyone would even know those monsters if they saw one. Then again there are so many monsters these days.” <br><br>With a flick of his wrist Flint rolled a snowball down the hallway. As it traveled it gained mass eventually forming legs and arms. The newly formed snowman seemed unstable on its feet. It quickly gained its balance and began waddling around the hallway. Finding Talia’s snowman, it began inspecting the possible friend.<br><br>“You know I first picked up a weapon when I was two years old and I had killed a man before I was five. The look in his eyes haunts me to this day. He seemed so surprised, who would have thought that someone so young could do something so…… vile. His eyes burned into me, I wanted to look away so badly. In the end I just couldn’t break his gaze. It was like I needed to remember my sin. But what is the weight of a life? Have I paid the price for my sin yet or will there be more to come? Is there really anything we can do to atone for the sins we have committed?”<br><br>Tilting his head back, Flint stared at the ceiling watching two flies buzz around an overhead light. <br><br>“I think I gave up on atoning for my sins a long time ago. I guess it makes life easier.”<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">To say that Talia was surprised to hear that the white haired boy down the hall had killed at an even earlier age than her would have been an understatement.  The look he mentioned seeing in the eyes of the man he had killed, the one that haunts him to this day, she had seen that look before herself.  She had seen it in the eyes of her father just before he was reduced to red mist, but oddly enough that wasn’t what haunted her.  Rather it was the look of sheer terror in the eyes of her mother after what she had done and the emptiness that she had felt within herself from that day on.<br><br>“I used to think that the weight of a life was dependant on the life in question.  My father was a monster and I always felt he got what he deserved...but, the weight of a life is the toll it takes on the person who ends that life.”  She looked back at Flint, tears filling her eyes now, “the toll of realising just how easily you snuffed them out.  It shouldn’t be that easy to kill, but when you’re cursed with power that you can’t control….sometimes it just happens.”<br><br>She cast her tearful eyes upon the floor once more, hugging herself tightly, “and it’s only a matter of time before it happens again.”  She whispered as she watched the waddling snowman, crying quietly.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Each second seemed like an hour as a nearby clock ticked rhythmically. The sound of Talia’s weeping was barely audible over the suffocating silence between the two students. Tears made Flint uncomfortable; he wasn’t sure how to comfort a female. Talia seemed so vulnerable; it was like she hadn’t opened up to anyone in a long time. Looking in her direction, Flint observed her face. The tears made her eyes glisten in the light and made small streams on her cheeks. Until now he hadn’t really noticed her eyes, they were a blue like his but they were a few shades darker. He wanted to help but wasn’t really sure how.<br><br>“There was a time when I was terrified of losing control. I felt so helpless whenever it would happen. Some of the teachers here know about it, although I don’t think it’s in my file. I think that I stopped fearing losing control once I realized that it was something only I could deal with. Others could give advice about it but in the end it was up to me. So I fought my demons and I came out alive.” Flint paused a moment before muttering. “For now at least.”<br><br>“As for taking the life of another person I agree with you. Maybe it shouldn’t be that easy. Then again humans are fragile, emotionally and physically. It’s hard to comprehend how something as delicate as us could be the top predator. And yet here we are, superior to the other species in so many ways. Despite our superiority the natural reaction to an accidental death would normally be saying not to worry it will all be okay. But we all know that’s a lie. We just tell ourselves that so we can have a sense of hope for the future. We hate the darkness so much that we try to ignore it instead of confronting it.”<br><br>Rising to his feet, Flint walked down the hallway coming to a stop in front of Talia. Squatting down, he reached a hand forward gently lifting Talia’s chin until their blue eyes met. With his free hand Flint wiped away one of the stray tears.<br><br>“Just remember it is not the things we have done that define us but the things we chose to do. Everyone here has skeletons in their closet; some are worse than others. The control won’t come easy but in time it will come.”<br><br>Wiping away another tear, Flint leaned against the wall across from Talia slowly sliding down the smooth surface until he was again seated on the floor.<br><br>“Let’s wipe up those tears now. When you’re ready we can go back in. People will probably start wondering why we have been gone so long.”<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Still sobbing softly, Talia continued to listen to Flint’s words and to her it sounded as if they were pretty much on the same page in regard to their beliefs about the current topic.  Her senses made her aware of his approach, but what she didn’t expect was when he suddenly raised her chin and looked into her eyes, speaking kind words to her while wiping away her tears.<br><br>No one had ever really tried to comfort her before, but then she had rarely if ever opened up to anyone before.  But not even her own mother ever really just listened to her feelings and tried to understand.  She always seemed content to let the past be past and never speak of it.  When she briefly looked into Flint’s eyes she saw a familiar sight.  The same emptiness that always stared back at her in the mirror.<br><br>She just stared at Flint for several minutes, still sniffling every once in awhile and then she wiped away a few tears.  “I’m honestly not sure anyone in there is going to be very happy to see me come back...aside from that overly arrogant comic book villain on stage”, she said with a slight frown.<br><br>“Wonder what sort of skeletons that guy has in his closet, probably plenty worse than either of us I’d guess”, she said with a slight smile as she wiped away the last of her tears.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Who knows what his skeletons are. One of them could be those huge eyebrows. We are going to have to sketch those into the yearbook.”<br><br>The sound of weeping had stopped and Talia seemed to be feeling a little better. A small smile spread across Flint’s lips as he thought of the intimidating teacher, forever pictured with monstrous bushy eyebrows. Just that one feature had made him seem angrier but harmless, kind of like a Chihuahua. Of course the eyebrows had fixed themselves rather quickly, but who could forget what had once been. <br><br>“I don’t really think it matters if the others want to see you again or not. We are kind of stuck here for now so it’s not like you can avoid them forever. You have to face them sometime and I don’t think it will be as bad as you think. Sure, some of them will be afraid, but a few might think it was amazing. I thought it was pretty impressive.”<br><br>Rising to his feet, Flint took a few steps toward the gymnasium door before stopping abruptly. A thought crossed his mind causing his to turn back toward Talia. Small ice particles began swirling in his palm. At first it looked like a small blizzard, some of the fragments collided and merged creating large pieces. Under his breath Flint uttered a word in the language of the Gelhaim and the small blizzard suddenly imploded into a solid crystal the size of a cherry. Its hexagonal shape glistened in his hand. As light entered the crystal it was torn apart and stitched back together before exiting creating the illusions that rainbows danced at its center.<br><br>“If you ever want to talk and I’m not around just break this. Now come on, the next demonstration could be starting soon and we wouldn’t want to miss it.”<br><br>Tossing the crystal to Talia, Flint turned and continued his journey to the door.<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia chuckled lightly at Flint’s joke regarding Silumas’ eyebrows and sketching them in the yearbook.  It had seemed like forever since she talked with someone that actually had a sense of humor or at least one that she was able to appreciate.<br><br>“Maybe we can present him with an award at the end of the school year for ‘most impressive eyebrows’ and make him feel all warm and cuddly inside”, she joked.<br><br>She thought over what Flint said about them being stuck here and she realized that he was right.  Her mother had sent her here because she didn’t know what else to do with her since she couldn’t always control her abilities.  Talia wanted to believe that she had done it with the best intentions, but the look of relief in her mother’s eyes as she left still left her feeling cold and alone.  Without any other place to go and knowing she would be a danger anywhere she did go this school, at least for now, seemed like the best place for her at present.<br><br>Talia was surprised at the strange ice crystal that was suddenly gifted to her and surprisingly it didn’t even feel cold like ice should.  Her vibrational senses could only tell her that there was something odd about the crystal’s molecular vibrations.  It definitely wasn’t a normal piece of ice, infact it almost looked more like a diamond shimmering with rainbows as the light passed through it.  Then Flint told her that if she ever wanted to talk and he wasn’t around to break the crystal, so obviously it was no diamond if it could be broken.<br><br>“I...thanks”, she managed to stutter.  She couldn’t recall the last time anyone had given her anything other than gifts that she got from her mother and the few relatives she had back home during the holidays.<br><br>She was still unsure about returning to the auditorium, but Flint’s attitude and his words seemed to give her confidence that she hadn’t felt in a very long time.  Looking over the crystal once more she slipped it into her left pocket and then stood up.  With a deep breath she hurried to catch up to Flint as he approached the doors.  She wasn’t certain what sort of reception awaited her inside, but she felt better now after finally opening up to someone.<br><br>“Wonder if we missed anything big.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Why don't we do a quick assessment for now.” Belwyn guided Garth gently back into the chair. “My power allows me to pinpoint any sites of injury in the body and in some cases repair damage done.” She took his hand again once he was seated. “Now, the sensation is a little bit different for everyone, but it wont be anything painful.” She explained softly and bowed her head. She thought for a moment then proceeded to close her eyes as well. Eyes turning from their normal light blue color to deep black at the use of her powers might be a little disconcerting to the students she decided.  <br><br>Belwyn's eyebrows scrunched together as she concentrated on Garth, picturing the different systems in her mind as she felt their condition. His respiratory and digestive systems seemed be the cause of his problems. They sustained mild chronic damage, which wasn't exactly surprising considering it was inflicted by his powers. This obviously wasn't the first time he'd used them. It also explained why he looked so sickly to begin with. He was probably eating enough, but his body was unable to extract the amount of nutrition he needed from the food. As for his lungs, they didn't seem to the filtering the air right with the over producing mucus, hence the deep coughing and bloody phlegm.  Perhaps she could offer his body some relief from the stress for the next few days. <br><br>Blue eyes snapped open and Belwyn's head whipped around as the ground began to shake.  Before she even knew what was happening, Garth was on his feet, flames of flashing color blocking the falling debris that had been heading straight for Ben and herself. Silumas quickly reinforced the rest of the building, stopping anymore pieces of the auditorium from falling away. Talia ran out of the room in a panic and Flint followed more slowly after her. <br><br>Belwyn jumped up to help Garth as he began to sway on his feet again and dissolved into another coughing fit.  It was too soon for his body to handle more of the power it seemed.<br><br>“Thanks for quick thinking.” Belwyn wrapped his arm around her shoulders so she could lead him to the nurses office. “Now lets go get you patched up some.  Perhaps the nurses office isn't such a bad idea after all.” She tried to keep her breathing steady with the stress of Garth's weight on her as they walked slowly out the door and into the hallway. Looking down the hall she saw Flint standing down the way from the girl's restroom. She gave him a questioning look, but he waved her on, so on she went with her patient in the opposite direction. <br><br>Not too far along, they reached their destination. As they stepped inside it was clear that this was anything, but an ordinary nurses station. There were, of course the normal tools you would see like, bandages, disinfectant, and the like, but there were also hanging planters on the walls filled with different herbs and flowers. Running water was heard from the corner of the room where a small stone water fountain gurgled happily. <br><br>Belwyn guided Garth to one of the cushioned chairs along the wall and let him take a seat. <br><br>“Well, I can heal some of it now,” she said putting her hand to his forehead, “but I would like you to stop by my office again later this week.  Maybe we can come up with something you can use to help yourself when I'm not around.”  Belwyn grew a little pale and cleared her throat softly as she began to take on the boy's symptoms.  She would probably feel like she had a bad cold for a few hours, but his healing should last for a few days before regressing again. It depended on how much he used his powers.  </div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Almudena Madeiro,” Thyra requested, hesitantly.<br> <br>“Si!” Almudena vaulted to her feet, her desk bucking up on two legs. She turned, and flashed a smile at Deandre, “Try to keep your jaw off the floor, ‘kay Literato?”<br> <br>She bounced up to the stage, and took the steps two at a time.<br> <br>“Oi! I’m Almudena Madeiro, but you all can call me Alma!” Her voice echoed through the room, even though Thyra had discretely switched off the microphone as the girl had bounded up the steps.<br> <br>“I’m from Mejico. Though you all probably figured that out by now, por supuesto,” She beamed, “I grew up in Iztapalapa, you guys know it as part of el Ciudad de Mejico. I’m from a boarding school, so I can show all you newbies the ropes. Por ejemplo, the best snacks to keep in your dorm, the best times to do your laundry, the best ways to distract the deans so you can get away with stuff-”<br> <br>“I’ll catch you yet, Madeiro!” Emily shouted, playfully shaking her fist.<br> <br>“Ah, si! Esto me recuerdo,” Almudena slapped the podium with a percussive bang, “Back home, my good friends called me Almudena ‘Mas Duro’.”¬¬<br><br>“Wait, isn’t ‘Mas Duro’ something people say during sex?” Jay asked the others in the bleachers quizzically, not checking the volume on his inquiry. After a pause for comprehension, the entire room erupted into titters and stifled laughs.<br><br>Almudena pursed her lips as the other students reacted, and brought a hand up, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. After a moment, her smile returned, even bigger and brighter than before.<br>	<br>“Si,” She threw her chin forward, puffed out her chest, and planted her feet wide apart, brazos en jarras. Almudena inhaled deeply, seemingly getting taller with the breath. Her eyes gleaming, she jerked a thumb towards her bosom, then retorted, “And I’m the reason why!”<br><br>If the room had been smoldering with barely repressed laughter before, it went up in flames now. The room dissolved into pandemonium, some students cackling, others elbowing eachother in the ribs, and some doing their best to look respectable as everybody else went crazy. Dalisay had nabbed somebody else’s textbook, and was currently holding it over her head like an umbrella.<br><br>“<b>Enough,</b>” Thyra spoke, snuffing out the conflagration with a single word. Almudena shot the woman a nervous glance.<br><br>“Uh…” Alma for once found herself without words, attempting a dismissive shrug, “En fin, I’ll show you guys my power now.”<br><br>Almudena hopped down from the stage, keeping her knees close together and pinning her skirt down with one hand. She landed in a crouch, her short hair falling messily around her face. Springing back up, she swept her bangs out of the way, tucking them behind her ears.<br><br>She purposefully strode over to the largest uncarved ice column left standing from Flint’s demonstration, and paced around it briefly, gauging it. Most of the others had either already started to melt or toppled during Talia’s demo, but this one was the size of a telephone booth, if not a little more robust. It’d work.<br><br>“Of course, Mas Duro can mean lots of things,” Almudena drew back her right fist, the transparent force once more appearing hovering above her forearm, “Por ejemplo, it can also mean-“<br><br>“More determined!” The pugilist lunged forward, throwing a haymaker of a punch. Before her knuckles, a battering ram of kinetic energy exploded forth. The blow slammed into the frigid monolith with a crunch that sounded like a high speed car accident, shards of ice exploding out to all sides. Alma’s punch has blasted out a chunk the size of an arm chair, leaving the huge hunk of rime teetering precariously.<br><br>“More intense!” Almudena pivoted on her feet, twirling around her target. She kept her right hand extended out to the side, looking almost like she was swinging a gigantic translucent flail. Alma took hold of her wrist with her left hand, bracing it. She spun to the opposite side of the pillar, putting all the force both arms could muster into a sweeping blow. There was a loud whoosh, like standing near a freeway as a huge truck shot by. Her whirling strike blasted out the remaining chunk supporting the column, sending it flying across the room. It slammed into a wall roughly twenty feet up, embedding itself in the concrete. The monolith itself fell sideways, landing across its former base at a skewed angle, reminiscent of a see-saw. Almudena gave a sparkling grin, planted her feet, and drove a sledgehammer blow into the raised end.<br><br>The car-sized hoary mass went flipping skywards, launched almost into the rafters despite weighing hundreds, if not thousands of pounds. Almudena looked up, and took two steps back, centering herself under the looming behemoth. She flashed another beaming grin, and gave a double thumbs up to the rest of the students, even as the gargantuan slab plummeted towards her.<br><br>“MORE BADASS!” Almudena brought her fists up in a double uppercut, twin bursts of force blossoming forth before her. They crashed into the center of the falling glacier. It hung in midair for a moment, as if gravity had been negated. An instant later, it was bisected by a jagged white fissure as Almudena’s dual blow plowed straight through it and erupted out the other side. The two hunks slammed into the floor on either side of her, cratering the flooring and hitting hard enough to make the desks jump.<br><br>Almudena brought her hands down, dusting them off as a shower of snowflakes rained around her. She was still smiling ear to ear, panting heavily.<br><br>“So, in a word, me,” She began casually strolling back to her seat, “Por supuesto, Mas Duro can also just mean ‘Harder’.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Echoing from the gym to the hallway, a loud voice told Flint that the next power demonstration was beginning. Unlike previous demonstrations this one seemed to invoke laughter from the students who had remained in the room. At first the laughter was nearly inaudible but it quickly grew, flooding the corridor. Another loud voice broke through the laughter causing it to halt. Stopping near the door, Flint could feel one of his pillars crumble from a powerful impact. As he pushed the doors open a flurry of razor sharp ice shards raced toward him. Despite the danger he calmly walked back toward the group of desks he had originally occupied. Each icy projectile arched harmlessly around his body before embedding themselves in the wall behind him. Shortly after the rain of death had ceased Flint could feel another cluster flying in his direction. Unlike the previous pieces this one was intact and had considerable weight. Stopping in his tracks he saw the icy slab rocket past just inches in front of him. Its polished surface reflected Flint’s face like a mirror. He could see Talia’s reflection as well; she had followed him through the door and dealt with the ice shower in her own way. <br><br>Finally reaching his seat, Flint perched himself on top of a nearby desk. The desk with a broken leg still laid on its side, rubble from the past few demonstrations had piled on top of its remaining good legs bending them beyond repair. Reaching into his bag, he pulled out a lollipop and peeled off its wrapper. Stuffing the treat into his mouth, Flint leaned back on the desk and watched Almudena split another pillar in half with brute force.<br><br>“I can’t decide who is more annoying, her or Emily. She is destroying my art.” Flint thought to himself as he pulled the lollypop from his mouth. “It is impressive though.”  <br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Eira and Aodhan decided they rather liked the snug little fort the Mexican girl had made for them. The black haired girl was quick on her feet, that was for sure. The twins had been more than happy to comply as she pulled them down and created the desk construct to shield them from the oncoming debris.  It had a nice five inch slit in between the desks where they could still watch the remaining demonstrations, but now they did it in relative safety.  Eira raised an eyebrow at her brother as he opened his grey sack and pulled out a small, deep green blanket with “Ireland Airlines” printed in the corner. <br><br>“You stole one of the blankets from the plane?” The corners of her mouth turned up in amusement. Aodhan grinned back at her. <br><br>“They throw them out after anyways.” He shrugged and crawled out long enough to drape the blanket over the back of their fort. Now that it was complete they both sat happily cross legged on the floor leaning in towards the slit as Ben took the stage. <br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Harue sat pensively on the edge of her seat as she brushed off the dust from her person. At this point, she was thinking that perhaps just staying ready to duck and cover was best.  She looked over at the twin's fort a little enviously as giggles erupted from inside. If she was any younger, she probably would have crawled in there with them. She took a deep breath.  There was definitely going be some serious stress management time after today.  <br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Jesse leaned back contently in her chair, hands behind her head as she watched Ben shift his form. Maybe she really <i>should</i> have been more specific about the whole “dodging hint” she'd given to Harue. The white haired girl seemed to be sitting on pins and needles. She was doing really well so far though! <br><br>Judging from the panicked whispers behind her, she wasn't the only one on edge anyway.  Personally Jesse didn't see what everyone was stressing over. They were already more than half way done with demonstrations and they hadn't even had one casualty! That was at least 60% better than any of the other realities she knew of.  <br><br>Jesse tipped back in the chair again as Alma took the stage. The girl's easy going nature seemed to ease some of the previous tensions in the room and even got the room laughing.  Why no one had laughed at her joke, she would never know. Perhaps she needed to start off with a shock factor next time... <br><br>Applause and whistles came from the desk fort next to Jesse as Alma slammed the ice pillar into the wall. Glancing to her right she saw Harue hiding behind her chair again and shook her head. Hopefully this year wouldn't be too rough for her classmate. It was bound to continue escalating from here.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">The squeak of rubber on polished wood followed Deandre as he crawled on hands and knees across the floor, jostling unoccupied chairs aside with his elbows and heedlessly carrying on (he would have feared this behavior could be seen as rude, if so many chairs hadn't already been knocked awry by Flint's and Talia's demonstrations). Hearing someone named Ben identify himself onstage, Deandre spared a glance to see the sporty-looking boy who had rushed to Garth's aid earlier. Quick. Write it down. Ben Something. Lexan? <i>Something.</i> He paused and sat back on his haunches, staring around the glossy floor. Surely Talia hadn't opened a crack in the...? Nowhere that he could see. They'd all taken a good rattling but the planks had held together. Ben was describing his power, shapeshifting, <i>shapeshifting</i>, well there'd be no forgetting that. Just only if Deandre could find the pen. Find the pen. Groping about half-attentively, trying to observe the event and find the means to describe it in the same moment, Deandre watched in fits and starts while the athletic boy transformed into something altogether different, something hunched and hooked, <i>like a chair getting ready to pounce</i>, he thought stupidly, though even as stupid as it was he would have written that down if he could. There were gasps, some of shock, some of admiration, but one boy in the bleachers had fallen back, breathing heavily, and had to be supported by his friends. It was the electronics boy, Carlos. Hue. Hugh. Hew. Hyoo. H U. Write it down. Only don't. What business is it of yours? They were exclaiming over him; a teacher had rushed to look after him; but the boy was stirring back to consciousness. Will you write it? Back to his human state, Ben hovered onstage, sure, Deandre didn't doubt, as he himself was, and everyone was probably, that it was the sporty boy's transformation that had triggered Carlos' panic. By and by, he saw himself off, prompting applause from some, hesitant claps from others, and silence from those nearest to Carlos. Unsure of whether to applaud or not, Deandre contented himself by slapping the wooden floor a few times as he searched on. That was one demonstration completely past. Remember it. Ben Lexan. Shapeshifter. Carlos. You'll remember it. You won't forget. Don't forget. Write it down. One demonstration past and the alphabet not even half gone. Who was next? Who hadn't he seen yet? The other, taller black boy at Carlos' side... and the Scottish girl, Nessa - poor Dalisay - and -<br><br>"Almudena Madeiro."<br><br>Deandre's eyes widened. He straightened up on his knees and turned back to see Alma kicking off onto her feet. With a cheeky grin down at Deandre, she called "Try to keep your jaw off the floor, 'kay, Literato?"<br><br>Dumbfounded, el Literato watched her leap onto the stage, plaid skirt whipping around her knees, and take the podium with a voice of inimitable confidence. Deandre had to tear his eyes back down to the floor to search for the pen, entirely missing the name of the area she was from, except that it was part of Mexico City. Write it down, you idiot, write it or it'll be gone someday. He propped himself up with a hand on an empty desk to look over the surrounding area. Alma - or Almudena, which he liked more, didn't he? Though who was he to decide how she should be called? - no, <i>Almudena</i> had been to boarding school already (with the penguins?) and knew the ins and outs. She was definitely one of the most exuberant speakers. She'd taken Miss Russell's "tell us something about yourself" to heart. Deandre hadn't, had he? Other than that he was from the US, he'd told them nothing else... Couldn't he have given them something, if not a demonstration? But without a demonstration, how could he justify wasting their time with words about himself? Deandre looked aside with a furrowed brow. He didn't need to pile on a third thing to concentrate on just now. Self-reproach could wait. Better to find the pen. Write it down. As if on cue, Almudena struck the podium with enough force and sound to wrench his attention back. "Back home, my good friends called me Almudena '<i>Mas Duro</i>'," she announced.<br><br>"Isn't '<i>mas duro</i>' something people say during sex?" the other black boy instantly wondered aloud, causing a ripple of barely-suppressed laughter around the room. Deandre clapped a hand over his eyes and snorted in spite of himself. A glance up at the front of the room, though carefully avoidant of Almudena, revealed CANDIDATE NUMBER ONE glowering resolutely at the ceiling, fingers interlaced on his lap, and this and the Mexican girl's proud response - "And I'm the reason why!" - were enough to set Deandre off again. While the rest of the auditorium erupted with guffaws, he pressed his face into his sleeve and buried his laughter in the folds of the hoodie. His face was feeling warm again. Covering half of it with his palm, he looked back up to the stage, grinning.<br><br>At a word from Miss Russell, Almudena wrapped up the introduction and took a heavy jump offstage, then strode over to one of the remaining ice pillars from Flint's demonstration, not far from where Alma's and Garth's group had been sitting. As students scooted their chairs aside to part the way for her, Deandre glimpsed a familiar flash of navy blue on the floor where her beige flats passed: The pen! How had it rolled off that way? That was the opposite direction from where he'd seen it bounce during Talia's demonstration. It didn't matter. In the general laughter over the other black boy's comment, Deandre hadn't put a thought to how much he was missing. Now he scrambled back and discreetly retrieved the ballpoint pen from the cleared path behind Almudena before ducking back into his seat. At last he pulled the book open again. He quickly wrote down<br><br>BEN LEXAN - SHAPESHIFT - CARLOS -<br><br>on the latest unfilled page before looking back up at Almudena.<br><br>"Of course, '<i>mas duro</i>' can mean lots of things. <i>Por ejemplo</i>, it can also mean - more determined!" She threw a punch that sent a projectile of force into the ice pillar, blowing out a significant chunk and weakening it. "More intense!" Another punch, and the pillar's support was entirely stricken away, leaving it to collapse at an angle onto the floor. Almudena brought her fists directly downward and flipped what remained of the massive chunk of ice into the air.<br><br>Quite a few students nearby shouted and shrank back, and CANDIDATE NUMBER ONE and the teacher with the messenger bag, the one who had attended to Carlos, both leapt to their feet, ready to intervene, but Almudena stood firm. His heart in his throat, Deandre had only a moment to process the sickly sight of the miniature glacier arcing down upon her stout figure before the girl shouted "<i>More badass!</i>" and jabbed both fists upward. The energy from her hands held the ice in midair for a second, then split it entirely in two, the hunks landing powerfully but harmlessly to either side, leaving the snowflake-dusted schoolgirl standing triumphant in between.<br><br>After a stunned moment, the auditorium erupted into the wildest applause since, perhaps, Flint's demonstration, if not Garth's. Paying no heed to the snowflakes melting into drops on the open pages of his notebook, Deandre clapped along, as loudly as he could, as Almudena Madeiro shook her hair out and strutted back toward their seats, her dark eyes shining. In the effort to keep his smile in decent proportion, the pen lay idle next to the book.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">ch00beh</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop clop<br><br>As the applause in the auditorium died down, a sound not quite unlike a cantering horse could be heard echoing out in the hallway and through the open door. The noise grew louder, and to those with a more discerning ear, it became more apparent that it was not the sounds of hooves on linoleum, but something of a facsimile. Like someone banging coconuts together for movie sound effects.<br><br>When the sound reached its peak, what appeared to be a pure black pony sauntered into the auditorium. Saunter was not quite the right word; the pony's legs moved more like noodles than muscles around bones, and the coconut sound was very obviously not in sync with each foot fall.<br><br>Atop the pony was a young looking girl, 11 or 12 at first glance, sitting side saddle and wearing a shadow black dress with bright blue embroidery. The bottom of her dress seemed to fade into the pony's body. A cowboy hat of the same color crowned the girl's raven-with-orange-highlights hair. She carried a parasol over her shoulder, despite the lack of direct sunlight.<br><br>"Howdy pardners!" Vieve said with a huge smile and a terribly overdone accent. Someone in the stands yelled howdy right back. "We were playing hide and seek and lost track of time. Sorry Miss Thyra!"<br><br>Attached to Vieve's parasol was a black rope trailing out the door. The Dawnchild gave it a small tug and a boy with neatly combed hair and pressed collar stumbled forward. "Say hello to Franky, everyone!"<br><br>Franky gave a sheepish grin at Vieve and everyone else in attendance. "Miss Vieve," <i>attract more flies with honey than vinegar</i>, "thanks for bringing me here but I don't think the ropes were really necessary."<br><br>"Hahaha Franky I'm on to you! You would've just escaped and play time is supposed to be over, young man." <i>It is really weird hearing someone who looks younger than me call me a 'young man.'</i> "Now, go sit with all your new friends."<br><br>With that, Vieve clapped her hands. A set of tattoos along her palm got darker, and the rope of shadow tying up Franky's hands dissipated. Vieve lifted her parasol and jumped off her pony, the fake animal also dissipating with a wave of her tattooed left arm. Instead of walking to the bleachers, the little girl skipped toward the teachers table, spun around and sat down, a chair forming underneath her out of her shadow. Vieve touched one of the tattoos on her shoulder and blackness enveloped the jug of chocolate milk on the refreshment table. She placed a hand above the teacher's table and the jug rose out of her palm's shadow. With a twirling finger, Vieve conjured up a black tea cup, poured chocolate milk into it, and raised it to her lips with lady like poise. It was then that she froze.<br><br>In fact, the entire room had frozen excluding Franky. "Thank God," he muttered to himself, rubbing his wrist.<br><br>"So that all played out well," he said to no one in particular again. Franky had been deliberately caught after orientation started. He was originally planning on being on time like all the sheeple, but after sneaking--well, not sneaking, more casually walking while time was stopped--into the dean's office to look over the files of the others attending Terminer, he realized he was dealing with some pretty extraordinary kids. This wasn't like his previous schools where he slipped in, got straight A's as the exemplary student in the classroom, and outside fostered a reputation as the kid who could get stuff done for you if you were a <i>friend</i>.<br><br>Franky didn't know they were going to do demonstrations, but once he read over the schedule and what the other kids could do, he realized he couldn't go up on stage like everyone else. His powers weren't meant for showboating; they were meant for getting stuff done. These kids were impressive, but most of them didn't know it. Most were <i>scared</i> of their powers. And they had spent the last 20 minutes awkwardly pouring their hearts out for the first time, or the more <i>experienced</i> had spent it dressing to impress for the 100th time. The pillars of ice, scattered flower petals, and cracked walls proved that thought right. Franky just couldn't do any of that razzle dazzle.<br><br>What he could do, however, was walk in super late because he had just beat the pants off a TA at hide and seek, then look like he casually teleported to a desk like it was no big deal. Franky looked at the audience. There was the clique, definitely didn't want to sit with them. Talia in the corner wouldn't like her personal bubble ripped into so suddenly. Garth was one of those kids who had a long history in the file, and Almudena, too, so him appearing in their group like it was no big deal would actually be treated like no big deal. But appearing on the outskirts, maybe next to the big boy Ty... that could work. Be the odd man out, but like it's still no big deal.<br><br>Franky walked up to the empty seat next to Ty, carefully making sure he didn't touch anyone or anything besides the floor. He gingerly took a seat, took a breath, then leaned back with his arms behind his head. "And now enters Franklin Elijah Timberland."<br><br>Vieve took a sip from her cup then suddenly glared at Emily. "Miss Emily, I smell cupcakes on you."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Howdy!” Emma Ray Jo whooped back, waving back to Vieve from her seat as the other girl came a-gallopin’ in on her catty-wompus horse. She bounded out of her seat, producing a sugar-cube from out of seemingly nowhere. The farmgirl moved briskly, her movements fast but steady to avoid spooking the varmint. She offered the critter the treat with her palm held flat, the horse nickering in response for a moment before its face snooted out like a melting candle and vacuumed the confection from her hand.<br><br>“Mahty fahn steed you got ‘ere,” Emma drawled, reaching out to scratch its forehead. The haint-horse dissipated into a cloud of shades swirling like tobacky smoke on an airish day, the sugar cube skittering across the floor.<br><br>“Aw, shucks. Twasn’t mah fault that critter disappearated, waren’t it?” <br><br>“Of course not, Miss Jo!” Emily flounced down from the stage, “Ray Jo? McCrowley Ray Jo? I never can get that name straight. But anyways-“ Emily fanned her hands out to either side,  producing a pair of cupcakes, “Of course! I wouldn’t forget a key member of our faculty, such as yourself!”<br><br>Emily tossed a black cupcake frosted in stark white, a spidery black design airbrushed across the top, to the Dawnchild.<br><br>“It’s black velvet with a cherry-cream cheese filling and frosting!”<br><br>She chucked the other one to Emma Ray Jo, who caught it without so much as looking towards it.<br><br>“...Tarnation,” Emma Ray Jo glowered at the miniature cake, which apparently had been stuck through with enough candy corn that it looked like an actual cob.<br><br>”Oh, come <i>on</i>. I’m not actually that evil!” Emily took hold of one of the kernels, and tugged. The baleful stockade of waxy candies unfurled from around the cupcake like an unspooling garden hose, dangling from a piece of floss. By the time she was done, a rich tan frosted cupcake with large brown crystals of sugar sprinkled across the top was left, only small pockmarks to attest to its former veneer. <br><br>“Molasses and ginger, of course!”<br><br>In contrast to most of the other young’un’s who would have been a mite peckish when confronted with such a treat, Emma Ray Jo heartily chomped into it and chewed thoughtfully.<br><br>“Golly! Land sakes alive, y’all fix vittles so plum divahn, ah’d thahnk ya were from th’ heavenly choir!” She clapped Emily on the back with her sticky mitt.<br><br>“I have no idea what you said, but I’m going to assume it’s a good thing!” Emily retorted, throwing her own arm over the farmgirl’s shoulder.<br><br>“Emma Ray Jo McCrowley,” Thyra read off from the stage.<br><br>“Jes’ a second,” Emma Ray Jo slipped free of Emily, and set to frantically masticatin’ what was left of her treat.<br><br>“If we could please get back to the demonstrations,” The superintendent insisted, firmly but politely.<br><br>“Hold on t’ yer britches,” Emma Ray Jo shoved the rest of the cupcake into her mouth, and stepped up to the stage.<br><br>Verdant motes began bubbling up around her hands, coalescing around her fingertips. She lowered her hands and pinched her fingers as if plucking something invisible from the earth. To either side of her, cornstalks burst up from the solid wooden flooring, pushing into her palms.<br><br>Lifted by the twin stalks, Emma Ray Jo stepped onto the stage, and turned to face the class.<br><br>“Well, howdy, y’all!  Ah’m Emma Ray Jo McCrowley, but y’all kin jes call me Emma Ray Jo!” She was greeted by a variety of baffled stares. One of the boys on the bleachers, who had been lookin’ as if’n he was going to lit out of there sat down, almost involuntarily like one of those faintin’ goats, upon hearing her voice. He gawped incredulously, and then mouthed something to his classmates.<br><br>“Ah’m from Brahtmeadow,” She offered.<br><br>“Brightmeadow,” The superintendent clarified.<br><br>“If ye’s from there, y’know it’s called Brahtmeadow,” Emma Ray Jo stamped one of her boots for emphasis.<br><br>Thyra paused, and thought for a moment. She’d always heard it called Brightmeadow, but who was she to say? There was no better way to earn the ire of a Salcesterish than pronouncing it Sal-sest-er, when anybody who’d been there more than a week could tell you the only right way to say it was Sal-stuh.<br><br>“Uhm, actually, it’s not...” Garth meekly raised his hand as he re-entered the gym, looking the rosiest Thyra had ever seen him. He didn’t even stumble or stagger as he made his way back to his seat by Ben.<br><br>“Shucks, y’all pitch the hay from’n the back forty on a day so hot the tar on the roofs is a-runnin’ lahk the Mississippi, an’ then Ah’ll let y’all tell me how t’ say it,” Emma Ray Jo crossed her arms imperiously.<br><br>“Anyways, you do have a Power to demonstrate,” Thyra tactfully changed the subject, before the girl ended up madder then a... wet hornet? Wet hen? The superintendent realized with dismay that she’d never spent much time in the rural portions of the Archipelago.<br><br>“Ah do! Shucks, ‘course Ah do!” The girl announced proudly, thumping her chest with one hand. She paused, pontificating, and did a short lap around the stage.<br><br>“If y’all was wonderin’, mah Power is the conjurificating of crops. Corn, namely,” Emma Ray Jo took a moment to observe her crowd. About half the high schoolers seemed incredulous, the others bored, while the middle and elementary schoolers seemed much more eager to see what this meant.<br><br>”Fer example-” Emma Ray Jo made the pinching gesture again, this time pulling her left hand away from her right hand. A mass of light appeared in her palm, taking the shape of a large ear of corn. Without hesitatin’, she twisted her hips and hurled the ear out over the other students.<br><br>It detonated with a noise like a string of firecrackers, showering the front row of the crowd in a wave of popcorn.  The fluffy kernels snowed down around the other students.<br><br>“That’s some of the fahnest feed corn in the whole of Brahtmeadow,” Emma Ray Jo lowered her hands to her sides, beginning to glow once more. “’course, Ah can manage a lot more than that.”<br>She raised her hands out over the stalks that had lifted her onto the stage. She made the pulling gesture again, but looped the movement of her fingers as if she was tying a knot. The verdant light faded, turning into a clear fluid and raining down onto the ears at the end of each stalk.<br><br>The farmer pounced down from the stage, drawing her whittling knife from her boot. She landed in a crouch, and rode the momentum of her fall, twirling to dissipate the force. As she rose to her feet, the two stalks slowly fell into her waiting hands.<br><br>Slowly at first, Emma Ray Jo began spinning the stalks, each one whooshing loudly on each go-round. The staff and students nearest to her could smell the distinctive tang of alcohol in the air.<br><br>“Is that-?” Thyra began.<br><br>“Ayup. Moonshahn. Or Ethanol, if y’all wanna be all fancy-schmancy about it,” The youth didn’t break her stride, instead accelerating her swings.  She threw one into the air, and spun forwards, catching it behind her back, “After all, t’ain’t nothin’ more than old corn, when y’all get down to brass tacks.”<br><br>“And you did this because?” <br><br>“’cuz this-” Emma Ray Jo threw the other stalk skywards, and drew her whittling knife once more. She skipped it off a piece of flint woven into a bracelet she wore, producing a spray of sparks. The ear at the end of the plant she held erupted into blue flames.  She thrust it at the other stalk, igniting it as it landed in her grasp. She crossed them in front of her before spinning them outwards, rolling them around her wrists with arcs of cerulean fire trailing her every motion.<br><br>“Ah might seem purdy talented at this-” She released her grip on one stalk, striking it in the mid-air with the other one. It spun, creating a gyrating wheel of flame that danced around her. The yokel brought her free hand up, catching the free-wheeling plant by the roots. Shifting her grasp, she raised each stalk above head level, and dropped to her knees, bringing them down in symmetrical curtains of cornflower blue, the flames the same color as her eyes. Emma Ray Jo remained on the floor for a moment, as embers from the charred corn wafted down around her like lightnin’ bugs on a summer evening.<br><br>Dropping the charred husks, she rose back to her feet, and curtsied delicately.<br><br>“But shucks, y’all, ya git good fast when ya practice with pitchforks covered in horse pucky.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">ch00beh</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Oh, Miss Cowboy Lady, don’t worry about Mister Ponyface, he didn’t really disappear to nowhere.” Vieve pointed to a spot on her left arm near the elbow. Nestled between runes and glyphs was a tatto or a rearing horse from the side. It was just a silhouette in black with no further details.<br><br>Vieve touched the tattoo’s head with her pinky then rotated her hand to trace along  a few other symbols. From Emma Ray Jo’s shadow sprang the pony’s head. Vieve made a wobbly gesture and the pony extended its neck in preposterous fashion tonoick up the fallen sugar cube. The head then got sucked back up through the farmgirl’s shadow.<br><br>It was then that Miss Emily satisfied Vieve’s greatest hopes and dreams and threw her a cupcake. Vieve jumped out of her shadow throne and caught the treat with both hands. Somehow, she managed to not touch the frosting.<br><br>“Haha spiders!” said Vieve as she saw the design. “Thank you Miss Emily!”<br><br>Vieve sat back down in her throne. As she did, the swirling blue embroidery on her dress shifted into spreading web-like patterns. She nibbled contentedly on the chocolate cupcake and watched Emma Ray Jo’s presentation, making sure to finish before the end so she could clap with real enthusiasm.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Belwyn opened the window in her office letting in the fresh air and light she and her plants needed. She closed her eyes, taking took a deep breath despite her now stuffy nose.  A look of peace came over her face, which now was visibly a shade or two paler. The moment to herself was much appreciated. <br><br>Garth had left a few minutes earlier after thanking her for the treatment and the cold-like symptoms had taken full hold now.  Grabbing a tissue on her way, Belwyn walked over to her essential oils shelf and selected some lemon and peppermint from it.  It was time to give herself a little treatment. <br><br>Once her water bottle was filled up with water, she put a drop of both oils in and shook it all together. <br><br>“This should help with the stuffiness.” she mumbled to herself and took a good gulp of the now flavored water. <br><br>Two small, blue butterflies danced through the window together as they entered the office, presumably attracted by the color and scent of the resident flowers. Belwyn smiled as they found a cluster of red they especially enjoyed.<br><br>“Well, you two enjoy yourselves. I have to head back to work!” After grabbing a few more tissues (just in case) Belwyn left the office for the auditorium, making sure to shut the door behind her. I wouldn't do to have the butterflies get stuck inside the building somewhere.<br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Jesse watched as Dreandre wrote quickly in his book. His powers were different here it seemed, so she wasn't quite sure what he was writing. By the way he would look up around him and back down to write, she could only guess he was documenting what was going on in the room. <br><br><i>“Well, if that's it- Oh! I could do that!”</i>  she thought and began rummaging through her school bag. <i>“Oh, but maybe I should wrap it first...or is that too much?” </i>she carried on looking until she heard the clop clop of hooves on the wood floor. Looking up she saw Vieve and Franklin enter the room.  She didn't seem to know much about this Vieve, but Franklin was pretty spot on as far as she could tell. It had only been a few minutes though. Best to give it time.<br><br>Emma began her presentation. It was really was quite a sight to see the corn plants grow so quickly. It reminded her of those time lapse videos that you would see on the internet sometimes or in wildlife documentaries.  <br><br>As the kernels of corn popped through the air, Jesse leaned back and opened her mouth wide. It was better than catching snowflakes!  <br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>“She's something of a bogtrotter, but it would'a been handy to have her around a few years ago.” Eira commented dryly as Emma finished her presentation. <br><br>“Are you joking?! The bird is class! Takeout snacks and pub.” Aodhan grabbed the hat off of Eira's head and ruffled her hair playfully, “Besides, we made through well enough.”<br><br>“Stop that! I already told you, you'll make it frizz!” She hissed out and swatted his hand away. “I'll look like a fuzzball.” Eira punched him in the arm.<br><br>“Ow! Don't be hitting your elders!”<br><br>“Stuff it. You don't even know who's the elder.” she said with a smirk, “I'm betting on <i>me</i>.” <br><br>The boy stuck his tongue out and poked her in the sides with his fingers. Eira covered her mouth, suppressing the squeak of surprise. Her eyes narrowed into a glare as her brother tried to hold in a laugh of his own. <br><br>~*~*~*~*~*~<br><br>Now, popcorn was something Harue didn't mind getting hit with.  She held her hands out as the tiny balls of white flew around the room. Her hat would have been perfect for this, but oh well.<br><br>The the laughter and commotion of the popcorn catching soon died down and Miss Thyra took the stage again. <br><br>“Would Harue Nekketsu please introduce herself.” <br><br>Harue's stomach did a few flips as she stood from her seat and talked onto the stage. She smiled as confidently as she could and took a deep breath to calm herself. <br><br>“Hello everyone! My name is Harue Nekketsu. I am 15 years old and am from Fukuoka, Japan.” Harue looked out at the crowd and clasped her hands in front of her to keep them from shaking. There was a short pause as Jesse gave her a thumbs up and wink from the audience. Harue's cheeks turned a little pink with embarrassment, but her smile was a little more genuine than before.<br><br>“So, a little about myself. Um, my hair is naturally white like this. It runs in my family.” her hand moved up to fiddle with the white section of the strands. <br><br>“That's usually the first question I get asked when I'm in a new class or school.” She thought for a moment. “I'm not really sure what else to say about myself, so I guess I'll just talk about my ability. I have a type of fire power I guess you could say, but it's nothing like what Garth can do. My blood is what sets things on fire, but don't worry, I'm not accident prone.” She attempted to joke,  “I was trying to think of a way I could demonstrate, but I hope you don't mind that I didn't come up with something. I just didn't feel like getting hurt.” She glanced over at Thyra who nodded approval.<br><br>“It's been wonderful to meet you all and to see all your demonstrations. Thank you.” she tried to keep a slow pace on her words, but rushed a bit in end, her anxiousness to get back to her seat winning. Harue's face grew a shade redder as she walked off stage. Public speaking was not something she enjoyed, but she felt she did pretty well even if she didn't have a presentation. <br><br>OOC:<br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler7833797').toggle();if($('#spoiler7833797').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler7833797"> Sorry to take so long everyone.

One panic attack was bad enough <i>not even during that weedy kid's show, no one reacted like that</i> and the fact that he kept on clocking Evelyn's eyes flickering over to him was bad enough. Hell, he couldn't be sure if he'd sort-of zoned out of reality for a second. It felt like he had, given that suddenly there was corn everywhere and there was a pretty distinct smell that couldn't be healthy. No, he definitely had. He pulled the hood of his jacket over his head and down too far to be because his ears were cold.<br><br>"Jamal Qadir, would you please take the stage?"<br><br>"It's Jay, my name is Jay, why do they keep on using my full name," he was muttering, and Carlos saw the excitement flicker from his face for a second. It was back in the next second, and Carlos felt himself being yanked up before it registered what was happening, his hood falling back and stumbling to keep his feet hitting the ground with any consistency <i>what the fuck jay get off</i>. <br><br>"I dunno the deets of what you did to the floor but it'll work, trust me," Jay was saying and Carlos finally got his feet underneath him, just in time to slide to a halt. He straightened up and fixed his friend with the most skeptical look he could. Not skeptical enough, based on Jay's grin <i>you couldn't think out a good plan if your life depended on it</i> and immediate departure to the main stage. Muttering curses under his breath, Carlos went back to the panel that he'd already probably caused security issues over. It hadn't been covered up yet, so he felt his way through the holographic interface and let the lights flood his mind. To anyone else, it might have been just a series of zeroes and ones, but it was paths and walkways and different turns he could take, like a maze. He hijacked the ceiling and made a camera spawn, just so he could keep an eye on everything that was going on while still interfacing.<br><br>Jay was taking the stage and <i>let's see what he does</i>.<br><br>"My name is <i>Jay</i>," he said, and Carlos saw the completely pointed looks at cupcake-lady and the Superintendent. "I'm a petty thief and I'm stronger than anyone else in this room."<br><br>Carlos zoomed in on the girl who had shattered the ice pillars and clocked her shit-eating grin and <i>is she just flashing two okay signs at him? Weird</i>. Creepy teacher was looking bored, which was pretty much par for the course when he wasn't dishing out creepy scrolls. The surfer-dude <i>I still don't get why he's wearing those clothes</i> looked interested. Jay was turning back to the surfer-dude now.<br><br>"What's the heaviest weight lifted on record?" He asked, and Carlos knew for a fact that Jay knew the answer to that, he'd caught the broader boy googling it a few days ago. Was this a game? Was Jay playing a game <i>what the fuck I didn't think he knew how to play games </i>because if it was, Jay should probably stick to his other strengths, and still Carlos wasn't really sure what his part in all this was. He was interfacing with this alien technology because Jay had asked him to, and yeah it was easy enough <i>there are lights flashing and I'm getting bored</i> but if he didn't have direction, he wasn't interested. <br><br>"Six thousand, two hundred and seventy pounds," the shorts-wearing-teacher piped up, and Carlos saw him sitting with his elbows on his knees.<br><br>"That's right," Jay replied, nodding. "Carlos, can you give me a set of weights that are that heavy?"<br><br><i>That heavy? I haven't even figured out how this technology works yet</i> there were flashes of light and voids and paths to follow. Carlos let his mind go blank and saw the lights, flickering on and off at every junction and he needed to follow junctions and backtrack to what he wanted and it was a maze of possibilities that he could see. The nanoweave of the floor in front of the stage started rippling and building. Carlos took a few shortcuts through the lights he could see, keeping an eye on how Jay dropped from the stage. Carlos smashed the biggest button on the console and turned away, keeping his left hand in the interface. It wasn't just a trick of the camera. The barbell weights he'd made out of the nanoweave had a diameter that was roughly the same size as Jay.<br><br>"Hey Kilik, try lifting this!"<br><br>The board-shorts teacher jumped down and rested a hand on the handle-bar between the weights. The look was skeptical, Carlos figured <i>are you doubting me or Jay</i> but he made an attempt to lift the weights. It was a pretty piss-poor attempt, as though he knew just how heavy the weights actually were and didn't look like he was putting that much effort into it. One aborted try and he just shrugged.<br><br>"Yep. They're heavy," he supplied, stepping back to lean against the stage <i>wonder why he hasn't gone back to his seat</i>.<br><br>"Really? I don't think so," Jay replied with a sarcastic smirk. <i>I'm pretty sure that's not the right posture for weightlifting</i> the weights were off the ground and Jay was lifting them effortlessly, like they were made of cardboard and not a densified nanoweave polymer of probably-alien origin. Jay did a few reps of lifting, then let the entire set fall to the ground with a crash that shook the entire gym. Even Kilik was looking impressed, which his friend would probably let go straight to his head if he turned around to see the expression.<br><br>"I don't know if you wanna give it a go, with your ghosty hand thing," Jay added, looking directly at Almudena, but there was a lighthearted tone to his voice and Carlos grinned at him, taking his hands out of the holographic interface. The weight set melted back into the floor as Jay walked past it and climbed the bleachers back to his seat.<br><br><br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler6945851').toggle();if($('#spoiler6945851').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler6945851">Lost steam towards the end here, but really, Jay's super strength legitimately isn't interesting to write about</div><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Well, golly!

She tapped her foot against the floor, demanding Deandre’s attention.<br><br>”He makes a big challenge, si? But notice how he had his buddy take the weights away before I could go up there and show him up. Pinche naco,” Almudena found something interesting to stare at in the direction exactly opposite Deandre, “Por supuesto, I couldn’t actually <i>pick up</i> those weights. I’m only human.

Dalisay Salazar?” Thyra glanced around the room.<br><br>After a moment, the little girl extricated herself from under her desk. She cautiously started towards the front of the room. A noise came from the bleachers, and she whirled about, her pigtails fluffing. It had only been one of the teenagers, kicking their feet up on the row below.<br><br>Good, still no sign of <b>them</b>.<br><br>Another few steps, another noise- This time, she managed to restrain herself to a simple glance. It was the blonde boy, Garth, opening the door to the gym. He met her gaze, and gave a friendly grin. Whatever the school nurse had done, he was looking even healthier and rosier than before he’d given his demonstration.<br><br>Demonstration, right. Dalisay grudgingly began walking towards the superintendent, taking deep, paced breaths. The last thing on earth that she wanted was to give a demonstration for everybody.<br><br>She took the stairs like she was walking up to the gallows. There was a thump- One of the twins had just upended another desk. Dalisay found herself wishing she was bold enough to make something comfortable like their little fort, but then again, she was disruptive enough without kicking over furniture on her own.<br><br>“Hello, everybody-” Stupid, stupid, why’d she need to say ‘everybody’? The longer she stood up here, the more time it gave them to show up.<br><br>“I’m from Threadneedle. I went to elementary school... Ah, third grade? No, I’m third grade this year,” Dalisay felt herself trembling. Warmth, on her cheeks- Oh, <i>great</i> she was crying.<br><br>“My parents had me learn how to play violin and piano, and I also do cup-stacking- And- and-” Dalisay realized she was out of breath. Was she breathing, even? Her nose was running all over her face, and-<br><br>No, no time to be weak, no time for lollygagging. Any time wasted was just another chance for her powers to ruin everything.<br><br>“Hm. Uh...” She whimpered, “Can I skip my demonstration?”<br><br>She felt a warm, soft hand on her shoulder. Miss Thyra leaned in close, smelling of fresh linen and lilac blossoms.<br><br>“Yes, yes you can,” The superintendent lowered her glasses, meeting Dalisay’s gaze. She produced a kleenex from her pocket, and offered it to the girl, “I understand.”<br><br>The girl sniffled, dabbing at her face. As an afterthought, she reached for the microphone.<br><br>“I didn’t introduce myself. My name is-”<br><br>“DALLAS!” Almudena barked out from her seat, cupping her hands around her mouth for additional volume (as if she needed it).<br><br>Dalisay dropped the microphone, which hit the floor with an echoing boom. She felt the tears welling up again, her heart pounding, her breath getting short and choppy. Balling her little fists so hard that her knuckles went white, clenching her eyes shut, she stamped her foot and screamed.<br><br>”My name is DALISAY!”<br><br>A gigantic leathery fist slammed into Almudena’s face. Tangled up in her desk, she fell sideways and skidded across the floor, barely missing plowing into Flint’s seat.The latina wrenched herself out from under the furniture and shoulder-rolled to her feet, the motion revealing that she’d thoughtfully worn a pair of modest black shorts under her dress.<br><br>She came up grinning, deep crimson blood running from her forehead and across one of her eyes. It dripped onto her blouse, seeping into the fabric. Almudena wiped the gore out of her eye, and regarded the being that had assailed her.<br><br>It was hunched over like a gorilla, muscles straining under a thick, matted coat of cerulean feathers. Instead of normal jaws, it had a huge, sturdy looking, slate coloured beak, slowly working open and shut with muffled clacks. For paws, it had huge, birdlike talons, covered in scaly yellow hide, with jagged, dirty claws. Its eyes were utterly inhuman, completely brick-red except for the pupils. It swayed back and forth, pitching forward on its unnaturally long arms as if getting ready to charge.<br><br>“No no no no no no no...” Dalisay whimpered, “I didn’t mean- I didn’t <i>mean</i>-”<br><br>“Me gusta tu amigos, Dallas!” Almudena laughed wildly. She reached up and undid her tie, throwing it aside, “Por supuesto, it’s my turn to say ‘hola’ now.”<br><br>The beast pounced towards Almudena with a warbling cry, bounding high into the air. As it came down, Almudena grabbed her desk with her right hand, and swung it overhead in a huge arc. It slammed into the creature with a ringing impact, jagged shards of the desktop clattering to the floor. The simian fiend tumbled to the side, rolled once and then landed on all fours.<br><br>Almudena dropped the shattered steel frame to the floor, and without turning, drove her left fist into the remnants. Her now familiar battering ram of force exploded into being, blasting the framework like it had been fired out of a cannon.<br><br>The avian creature snagged the jagged wreck out of the air with one gnarled paw, and flung it back at the pugilist.<br><br>“No mames!” Almudena slapped the projectile aside in another transparent burst, embedding it in the concrete wall.<br><br>“Te crees muy muy, oy?” Almudena slammed her fists together, her clothes rippling in the wind from the impact. She began striding towards the beast, her steps measured and shoulders squared, like she was preparing to discipline it.<br><br>“OI! Dallas!” She barked, “If I break this loro of yours, it won’t break you, will it?”<br><br>Dalisay peered out from behind the podium, where she’d been cowering. Her gaze was hard, resolute.<br><br>“It won’t!” She stood up, her legs trembling, using the podium to keep her balance. “But even if it did, I’d tell you to do it!”<br><br>“Muy bueno,” Almudena beamed. The ape rose up on its hind legs, and pitched forwards, aiming a gigantic slap at the student. She responded with a twitch of her wrist, a bloom of vitreous impact not only blocking the swing, but crumpling its thick fingers like they’d been made of paper. She stepped in, taking hold of one of its shattered digits, and wrenching it.<br><br>“Now, I’m not sure if you were listening, amigo, when I said this earlier...” Almudena drew back her right arm, her well defined muscles tensing. She clenched her fist.<br><br>Using her grip on its broken hand, she reeled the ape in and launched a gigantic punch, all in one well-practiced motion. A wave of kinetic force slammed into its torso, first flattening the feathers, and then pushing into its chest. The beast gave one panicked squawk as it bulged outwards like a balloon, and then exploded into a cloud of nothing but greasy blue feathers.<br><br>“I’m a very firm believer in proper punishment.”<br><br>Almudena waved one of her hands, parting the cloud of feathers so that she could walk through. Dusting herself off, she grabbed a spare desk, and dragged it back to where she’d been sitting. She plunked herself down next to Deandre again, caked in blood, cement chips, and a considerable amount of indigo plumage.<br><br>“And... Ah,” Dalisay’s lip quavered.<br><br>“That is my power.”<br><br>From the center of the room, she heard a single figure clapping loudly- Almudena, applauding getting mauled by what was possibly the most dangerous manifestation her powers had ever taken.<br><br>“Venga!

Though she would never admit that the beast that the young girl scared her so badly she had nearly ran from the gym, Nessa cheered all the louder to try to show Dalisay that she shouldn't be afraid of her powers as she seemed to be. Nessa knew all to well what it felt like to fear ones own natural ability. She'd been taught to be afraid of what she could do but refused to let that hold her back. Nessa was hard headed in the extreme and didn't much care who knew it. <br> <br>"Bloody brilliant, love!" <br> <br>Nessa slid away from her desk and past Almudena into the debris field left by the ape-bird. She bent down and gathered a few handfuls of feathers before taking a seat on Almudena's new desk. A few quick, practiced movements brought the mass of feathers into a wreath of sorts, much like a crown, which she placed around  her new Hispanic friends temples. Nessa grabbed Almudena's wrist and pulled her hand upwards and pointed at the bloody girl like the referee in a boxing match. <br> <br>"All hail our grand hero! All hail Alma, the Beast Slayer!" <br> <br>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* <br> <br>Ty noticed things. He'd always noticed things. Though he wouldn't claim himself to be the most observant person in the world it was very hard not to pick up on some major tone changes in the room. The building nearly fell, ice pillars were created and destroyed, sand floated, weights were lifted, and all of it was giving Ty a tension headache. He knew what he could do, he knew his feelings about his powers, but how casually these other people tossed their power around left Ty feeling uneasy. <br> <br>furniTy's energy was running low, both from his demonstration and from being around people for such a long period of time. Ty, in true introvert style, needed time away from the general public to allow his batteries to recharge. He was just about to step out of the gym for a breath of fresh air when a massive bird-gorilla hybrid exploded into the nearby group of students with a sickening punch to the face of the latina boxing queen. Ty ducked behind a desk and very ungracefully failed at covering his head with a chair. As the rumbled between the beat-em-up beauty and the beast wrapped up and the thunderous applause of Alma and Nessa rang through the high ceilings above, Ty came out of his furniture fort and tried to stand it back up properly without being noticed. He failed. Ty dropping the desk on his foot and cursed loudly before regaining his seat. He averted his eyes away from what he knew would be a stern glare from the staff and wished that he was anywhere but there.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler1860881').toggle();if($('#spoiler1860881').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler1860881"> Why is it so hard to find TY's voice again? </div></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Harue watched as Ben compared his strength with one of the other school staff.  Nothing was hurtling towards her for this demonstration, so that was a plus. Strength struck her as one of the more practical powers someone could have. There were lots of things you could choose to do in life with super strength. Normal jobs even. Fire blood on the other hand, not so much. She certainly wouldn't be working in a hospital, that was for sure.<br><br>“Sooo...” Jesse's voice came from Harue's left, “you want some popcorn? I brought salt and everything!” The girl smiled hopefully at Harue. The white haired girl turned to see a modest pile of white puffs gathered on her peer's desk. A smile broke out on her face. What a day it was. <br><br>“Why not?” Jesse's face lit up at the acceptance of her peace offering and Harue couldn't help a quiet laugh as she reached over for a few kernels. Maybe she was just going into shock from the events of today, but she found herself becoming almost resigned with her new situation and surroundings. Lots to call home about for sure.  <br><br>~*~*~*~*~<br><br>“Well that's somethin' you don't see every day.” Eira wasn't quite sure how to feel about the odd creature Dalisay accidentally released into the room. “ So, we should probably stay clear of tantrums from her then...” Aodhan's mind went to work, not for the first time that day. <br><br>“Maybe... or maybe it's all about timing.” His sister raised a brow at his comment. <br><br>“Riiight... You know, you're scary with that look sometimes.”<br><br>“Only sometimes?” Aodhans face was a picture of feigned surprise.  <br><br>“Well, all the other times we're usually plotting together, so it kind of cancels out.” Eira played along.<br><br>“True -” A gust of feathers blew in though the slit between the desks at the force of Almudena's attack. The boy dissolved into a coughing fit, effectively cutting off their banter. Eira pat him firmly on the back.<br><br>“Geez, what now? Do we need to get you an inhaler?”<br><br>“Feather.” he wheezed “Throat.” after a few more minutes of struggle and a legitimately concerned sister, the saliva covered feather was extracted. <br><br>“I'm glad you're alive, bro... but that's really gross.” Eira wrinkled her nose.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">FARMGIRL?

And even though, for all he knew, this might be the one that would finally bring the auditorium crashing into dust, Deandre couldn’t pretend not to be curious.<br><br>But he had to set the pen down at the sight of the black-haired girl trembling in tears onstage: His heart went out to her. When, a moment later, she asked in a quivering voice to skip her demonstration, some sense of obligation drove Deandre to cap the pen and close the book for a moment, storing both in the front pocket of his hoodie. Only the white-haired girl, Harue Something, had managed the feat of yielding her demonstration gracefully and without losing face, leaving Deandre to wish he had that kind of composure - and, he was sure, leaving Dalisay to wish the same. At least the petite, cross-footed Dalisay could easily claim sympathy from the rest of the students - except, it seemed, Almudena, who let out a disappointed huff when the younger girl asked to skip her presentation, and who didn’t even let her get through her introduction:<br><br>“My name is--”<br><br>“DALLAS!”<br><br>When Almudena grinned in his direction, Deandre forced a chuckle, a token effort to show her he was on her wavelength, despite inwardly feeling that the last thing it looked like Dalisay wanted right now was to have her introduction dictated by someone else. Her reaction would prove him right: Dropping the microphone, red-faced, she shouted “My name is <i>Dalisay!</i>”<br><br>And then a beast from a Guillermo del Toro nightmare fell out of thin air and lunged directly at the Catholic schoolgirl, jolting the neighboring Deandre so hard he fell backward, desk and all, and nearly cracked his head on the floor.<br><br>When he pulled himself together, blinking through flashing stars, it was to see Almudena standing bloodied and bold opposite her attacker, a monster with the hulking physique of an ape but the claws and beak of a bird of prey, complete with its coat of bright blue feathers. Not to be caught off-guard twice, the schoolgirl intercepted its next lunge by splintering her desk over its head, then followed up with a punch that sent the desk’s metal frame rocketing toward the creature. But with reflexes that suggested a falcon more than an ape to Deandre, the beast caught the frame and hurled it straight back at Almudena. In a limber, easy motion, the girl deflected the missile and pounded one fist over the other with a defiant smile. Deandre couldn’t help but smile a little at the sight, too; well, maybe he <i>was</i> on her wavelength. There was a helplessly infectious way about her - someone truly living every moment in the present, in a way he could never, as much as he’d like.<br><br>In this short moment of calm, he looked first to the podium, where Dalisay was crouched for safety, and then at the bristling creature. No question it was summoned here by Dalisay, but going off her fearful gaze now, and her despairing way of telling him about the breakage she’d caused back home, he doubted whether she’d called the creature here on purpose. Maybe an emotional response to Almudena’s teasing?<br><br>Of course the temptation, faced with those red eyes that never seemed to blink, was to use his power on this alien monster while he had a chance.<br><br>He knew it was a bad idea - using his power on nonhuman targets was a fraught business. He’d given it up long ago, after the experiments of his late single-digits and preteen years. Dogs and cats weren’t horrible: There would be something he could almost certainly understand, a heightened sound or scent, or a recognizable image, though distorted and filtered, perhaps all done up in the wrong colors. A meadow of pale yellow grass and grey shrubs, or a fireplace with a crackling dark brown flame. But the day he’d been young and foolish enough to use the power on a bumblebee, he got nothing better to show for his troubles than a headache and the implacable sense of carrying his body south.<br><br>Too, there was the worst fear of all, the fear of losing one of his own memories forever to a brain that could never repeat it, could never even understand it…<br><br>Deandre had no time to make a decision. Almudena was striding forward, calling to Dalisay, and the younger girl’s encouraging response signalled an end to the fight. The beast should have known better than to try to take the Latina on at close quarters, but after breaking the digits on one paw, she detonated the ape-bird with one summary punch, leaving a cloud of feathers where it had been stooped beneath her grip. Without missing a beat, as if she had just done the most natural thing in the world, Almudena seized a spare desk and started back toward the cluster where she’d been sitting before. Deandre had enough time to right his own desk, pick something else up off the floor, and take his seat again before Almudena swung the new desk around and landed heavily next to him.<br><br>“And, ah - that is my power.”<br><br>Since Dalisay didn’t seem at all affected by the death of the ape-bird, Deandre guessed this must not be the only one, or that it regenerated with every summon. He was glad to see her seemingly more cheered by the incident than anything else, but found dazedly, not for the first time today, that he couldn’t tell whether or not to clap. Among the first few students who did were the Scottish girl Nessa, and Almudena herself, who launched into vigorous applause and cheering, face red and hair tousled, totally unrestrained by concern for her disheveled appearance. Deandre swallowed.<br><br>“Here’s…”<br><br>The necktie dangled from his outstretched hand.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">ch00beh</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Franky yelped in surprise and jumped out of his seat, his desk clattering to the ground. Everything else stayed still.<br><br>Frozen in a moment and spitting distance away was an ape shaped <i>demon</i>-bird. Its clawed--taloned?--fist was planted firmly in Almudena's face, and all around there were wide, surprised eyes and partially agape mouths. On stage, Dalisay had her face buried in her hands.<br><br>"This guy is a <i>scamp</i>?" Franky said aloud, looking at the frightened filipina girl. She obviously did not respond. "Ridiculous. But... it could be useful to have a nuke around during a knife fight."<br><br>Franky took a couple deep breaths to steady himself, then picked up his chair and put it back where it was. He didn't sit down immediately, though, and instead walked up to the the demon to take a good look at it. He walked around the demon and Almudena, keeping about a step or two of distance between him and them--he didn't want to risk any chance of touching them and unfreezing them. That thing was <i>big</i> and it was really laying into Almudena. The girl, though... something in her eyes were lit up, and not in the angry kind of way. The excited kind of way. Weird. Franky stepped away and made his way back to his seat.<br><br>"Let's see how this plays out, then."<br><br>The world snapped back into motion and Almudena flew through the air. The two exchanged frenzied blow after blow. It was captivating, but Franky also couldn't help but notice that the teachers hadn't moved an inch to step in. The excited look in Almudena's eyes started to make sense, but the passive staff did not. Weirder and weirder.<br><br>Franky snapped out of his thoughts with the sounds of snapping bone followed by a wet explosion. He was staring. <i>Okay. She's the nuke you bring to a knife fight. Not the scamps.</i><br><br>Almudena haphazardly banged another desk down and sat down, and again time froze. Franky got out of his seat and made his way toward the brawler, pushing a nearby desk right behind her. He took a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped the seat down, sat down, and unfroze time. He was holding the handkerchief by Almudena's shoulder as if in offering. "That was awesome."</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Gracias, gracias,” Almudena shook her fist triumphantly as Nessa raised her arm in the air, “Por supuesto, está todo en un día de trabajo para mi.”<br><br>It was then that she noticed Deandre holding her tie. Gently pushing through the crowd, she circled around her desk, and ended up face to face with him. She took hold of her tie, her fingers brushing against his.<br><br>“<i>Muchas gracias</i>, Literato,” She bowed her head, and planted a light kiss on the back of his hand, her lips soft and warm against his skin. Almudena raised her gaze to meet his, her eyes sparkling, for just a moment before drawing away. A drop of blood from her forehead dripped onto his wrist as she stood back up.<br><br>Almudena gave an off-kilter smile and an oddly girlish giggle. She spun on her heel, fumbling to sit back down at her desk. Slipping her tie on once more, she wordlessly accepted the kerchief from the younger boy. Acting like she was dabbing up blood, she covered the side of her face that was towards Deandre. Her ears were obviously blushing bright red, however.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">AngelicTragedy</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Right then, Nessa Weir," Thyra called in an attempt to break the spell the scamp seems to have cast over the student body. <br> <br>"Watch this, hen. You should enjoy this," Nessa squeezed Alma's wrist before starting a swaying saunter towards the stage. <br> <br>Nessa's every move seemed to be utterly carefree as if she was always walking on air. The bells on her necklace sang a jaunty tune as her stiff soled boots clacked across the somewhat scuffed gym floor. Cobalt feathers were ground flat or blown aside with each sure step almost as if a path was opening up behind the Scottish girl. Nessa flashed a winning smile at everyone that she walked past that verged on almost too perfect. Nessa had the air about her that she was almost to perfect physically, as if she'd been carved from stone rather than born of flesh. As she neared the steps of the stage, Nessa met Dalisay and dropped down quickly to one knee and snatched the young girls hand up with her own satin gloved hand. <br> <br>"Love, you're bird monkey thing was really brilliant. If you need anything you can come to me, 'kay? You remind me of me a few years back," Nessa whispered, gently squeezing the girls hand, and gave her a brief hug. Though the gesture was sincere it was quite obvious that Nessa took great care not to allow the skin on her neck and face to touch Dalisay's own skin. <br> <br>Nessa released Dalisay and skipped up the steps towards the podium. She snatched the microphone from its mount and grinned at the staff assembled on stage in her most winning fashion. With a quick spin and a wave of curls Nessa had taken over the stage with such a commanding presence that it was hard to believe that she hadn't just been doing flips or juggling chainsaws.  <br> <br>"Mental morning, aye? I'm Nessa and as I'm sure you can tell I'm from Scotland. I'm not sure what else I should say from here really. I like to sing, but I guess that's not why I'm here, aye?" Nessa cast a glance back over her shoulder at Thyra as if judging if she really wanted to continue. <br> <br>"Oh well, there's no real point in hiding it. When me mum signed me up for this place I was asked not to discuss my powers with anyone but you'll all find out soon enough anyway, so how about we have a bit of a show. <br> <br>"Nessa, you really don't have to do that," Thyra began as she took to her feet. <br> <br>"It's alright, I want to." <br> <br>"I'm not so sure that's the best decision," an ever slight edge creeped into Thrya's voice. It didn't sound like she was angry but more concerned. <br> <br>"Ya see, my powers came with a few odd side effects," Nessa began down the steps from the stage and back along the path between the feathers she'd created. "I like to say that my power is to bring out the best in people. My powers seem to have left me unable to be physically damaged. I've never had a scar or pimple, I've never had bruise, my voice never cracked. I thought that was as far as it went, but then I started going through puberty and I kissed a boy for the first time. He turned into granite statue." <br> <br>Nessa paused the story and looked over the crowd. She hadn't changed tone from her joyful sing-song speech pattern as she spoke about a boy turning to stone. She didn't sound happy per say but she didn't exactly sound sad about the whole situation. Nessa took a moment to look for disgust on the faces of her classmates before continuing. <br> <br>"Turns out that the boy that I kissed was a power too except that his powers hadn't surfaced. I had doctors and scientist poking and prodding me for weeks afterwards tryin' to figure out what had happened. The best that they could tell is that the hormone changes had changed my power. They told me mum and I that I'd developed the power to awaken dormant powers and empower existing powers. I also gain an understanin' of what their power is. Long story short, if I come into skin to skin contact with a power I raise them to the maximum limit of their powers whether they can physically handle it or not," a broad smile sweeped across Nessa's face as the room when utterly silent. <br> <br>"Now you know when I wear the gloves," Nessa had come to a stop next to Jesse and slipped one of the long black gloves off her hand. "How about a bit of a demo, aye? Relax love." <br> <br>Several things happened all at once. Nessa pressed her hand onto the back of Jesse's, a soft white radiance shone between their skin. Marius sprang from his seat, yelling out a desperate warning, and began to sprint towards the steps but didn't get far. The minds of everyone in the room burst into a cacophony of color and images. Everyone seemed to be experiencing the same images, flashes of people and places that seemed almost familiar, before being joined by sound. Laughter, talking, songs, and ambiance mentally smashed through the consciousness of the assembled powers. Faintly in the room a scream rang out but it was masked almost entirely by the chaotic flashes and booming noise. <br> <br>After what seemed like an eternity the sensations began to calm and an image of a hellscape unfolded in the whole schools mind. A red sky hung heavy over charred grass and blackened stone. Fires burned at random among the ruins of a building sending pillars of caustic smoke pouring into the thick atmosphere. The image began to move as if viewed by some bird of prey over the obliterated landscape. The vision came to focus on an open plane ringed black flame. In the center stood a throne made from piled skulls that sat empty. Behind the throne rose pillars of black stone to which the lifeless bodies of all the Terminer staff were chained. Below the hanging corpses were long chains connected to black iron collars that ringed the necks of the students of the academy. A manic laughter cracked out from behind the black flames and a pair of glowing orange eyes shone through the darkness. <br> <br>The mental image began to darken but the laughter rang clear for a few long moments that felt like an eternity. The vision and sound faded only to be replaced by the scream that started before. Nessa's vocal cords were raw form the anguish of her cry but she couldn't seem to make it stop. Her eyes were locked on Jesse, a look of pure grief and regret played against her perfect features, as she pulled her hand away from Jesse and covered her mouth to stop her wail. A moment of silence fell and Nessa quickly strode back up towards the stage where Marius stood halfway to the stairs with a look of utter confusion on his face. Nessa sheepishly grinned at him before placing the microphone back in it's holder and replacing her glove. She cleared her throat as best as she could before smiling once again. <br> <br>"Hey, on the bright side, we as least know that is a possible future. Doesn't mean that it will happen/" Nessa laughed slightly and turned towards Thyra. The two locked eyes and Nessa mouthed an apology before striding back to her seat.<br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler2437851').toggle();if($('#spoiler2437851').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler2437851"> I know that I've given out a lot of new Nessa info, but also a lot of new questions have been raised.

No one really seemed to notice her return, other than maybe Silumas.  He never looked directly at her, but she could swear that she felt his eyes burning into her soul at the moment she walked back through the doors earlier.  Some of the other students might have given her a nervous glance or two, but she otherwise felt fairly invisible, which she was ok with.  She had always hated being the center of attention.<br><br>Talia hadn’t really been listening to the speech given by the girl named Nessa Weir, that is until she mentioned kissing a boy who then turned into a granite statue.  At that a look of puzzlement covered her face as she looked to the stage.  <i>She kissed a boy and he turned to stone?  What is she?  The long lost cousin of Medusa?</i>  She thought to herself.  Then her speech continued as she spoke of awakening dormant powers and even further empowering those that already existed ‘whether the person could handle it or not’.  Talia’s eyes went wide as she watched Nessa walk amidst the student body.  The demeanor in which she spoke of this furthered her terror as it almost seemed that this girl didn’t even care about the potential consequences of such a thing.  For all Talia knew she might even take some twisted pleasure in it.<br><br><i>If she touched me….</i>, Talia’s mind couldn’t even begin to comprehend the potential consequences.  She already had little to no control of her powers and yet this girl, through mere touch, could send her already dangerous ability spiraling out of control to possibly apocalyptic proportions.<br><br>Gripped by terror Talia slipped out of her desk and began to back away from where Nessa had come to rest in front of Jesse.  As the girl touched Jesse there were suddenly images moving rapidly through her mind, some familiar, some even like memories, but different, slightly altered.  And then destruction, scorched earth, death, evil, fire.  Was it her?  Would she cause this?  No, it was something else, something darker, the faculty chained, choking smoke, she could feel the metal collar around her neck, choking her.  It was all too vivid.  There was a piercing scream, laughter as the world burned.  Talia huddled into a ball on the floor, holding her ears, her eyes closed tight.<br><br>Finally it stopped, everything was normal again, but far from ok.  Everyone seemed stunned, confused and within seconds she could see some descending into sheer terror, even more so than after her demo.  Why had the girl done this?  Had she meant to?  Was it just for shits and giggles?<br><br>All Talia knew for sure was that this girl, Nessa Weir had just shown herself to be the most dangerous thing here for her.  If the two of them ever came into contact, Talia was convinced that her powers would destroy everything, maybe the entire island.  Watching the girl saunter back to the stage Talia decided that she would need to be avoided like the plague.  If she ever developed some twisted desire to destroy the school and everyone in it, she would have to look no farther than Talia herself.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Jesse grinned and did her best not to bounce in her seat as Nessa came to a stop in front of her. She'd never before had the chance to work with the redhead in any of the other dimensions she'd visited. The prospect of having the opportunity now, was rather exciting to her. She wasn't quite sure what to expect as Nessa's soft hand descended on the back of her own. The warm tingle of their powers coming into contact was quite pleasant, but as she turned to look at the staff and teachers seated in front of her, the world seemed to melt into a constant state of motion. Left, right, up, down, spiraling, so many colors and shapes.  <br><br>A number of thoughts flew through the English girl's mind as she blinked and shook her head, trying to get a handle on the intense increase of her powers. Firstly, it was a very good thing she didn't get motion sick. Secondly, It was also a good thing that humans generally only had ten percent of their brain in use at one time. If she hadn't had the rest “open for expansion”, she was sure her head would be exploding at that moment. In fact, with an infinite amount of dimensions to view and absorb, she decided she had better get things under control or soon that was exactly what would happen.<br><br>Loud, quiet, cold, hot, bright, grey, dark, it didn't matter where she stopped, as long as it stopped. Jesse concentrated with all she had on one point and followed it down the moving fractals of reality. <br><br>At first, it wasn't all that bad as the dimension came into focus. Wind through her feathers, warm air...Wait. She had feathers? Her mind sharpened yet again. She was IN the air!? Jesse took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. Today was just full of new experiences. She knew that logically, somewhere, there was a dimension where she was a bird, but she had never explored quite that far down the spirals. Tuning in more closely to her bird-self, she realized the feelings of dread coming from it's mind. <br><br>It was a struggle, but finally her vision cleared and the landscape came into view. Mendacious laughter,  death, fire and the sickening smell of everything burning around her hit her senses. She might not get motion sickness, but scenes like this <i>did</i> make her sick. Jesse tried to calm her own heart, but failed as a sharp scream pierced through the air and into her ear. Startled, but realizing the sound came from where her body was, not her mind, she latched onto the sensation of the sound. Jesse snapped herself back into the room just before Nessa pulled her hand away.  <br><br>Jesse slumped against her desk as she concentrated on holding in what ever breakfast she'd eaten that morning. When Miss Belwyn came back she was definitely going to excuse herself into her care. Whatever Nessa was saying up front didn't really make sense in the light brunette's mind yet, but as Nessa walked back to her seat, Jesse tugged on her arm sleeve. <br><br>“Hey, so, being a bird was awesome, but maybe in a happier place next time?” she gave a queasy, but good-natured smile.  </div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">LeeTupper</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Alma?

Almudena raised an eyebrow, and the younger girl winced as if the teen had raised her fist.<br><br>“I’m sorry,” The child managed to blurt out. She ducked her head and took a step back.<br><br>Almudena kicked up to her feet. She began walking towards Dalisay, wordlessly.<br><br>“I’msorry, I’msorry, I’m-” Dalisay was cut off by Almudena scooping her up in a gigantic bear hug.<br><br>“It’s okay, hermanita,” Almudena swayed back and forth, Dalisay’s shoes dangling well above the gym floor, “What are sisters for, after all?”<br><br>Dalisay looked up, incredulous.<br><br>“You’re not my sister...”<br><br>Almudena set her down gently.<br><br>“Family is more than blood, niña.” Almudena put her hand on Dalisay’s head, steadying the still-trembling child, “And hey, when la hermana mayor es una china en tu zapato, some times you gotta bust her face to get her attention.”<br><br>She turned away, and walked back to her seat.<br><br>“Isn’t that right, Dallas...ay,” The latina grinned mischievously.<br><br>It was then that la Pelirrojo lit the whole gym up with visions of carnage, and for the first time today, Almudena was completely taken aback. She sat up straight in her seat, her face going pale. The pugilist clenched a fist so tight that her knuckles popped, little sparks of transparent force bursting wildly from her hands and hitting her desk like thrown stones. Taking a ragged breath, she loosened her clenched grip, and touched her right hand to her forehead, then her chest, and then each of her shoulders.<br><br>“En el nombre del Padre, y del Hijo, y del Espiritu Santo...” She clenched her jaw, and gulped, “Amen.”<br><br>Almudena raised her gaze fiercely as the vision faded. Though she’d been shaken, she still managed to catch the words ‘possible future’.<br><br>“El Literato,” She spoke, her voice low and ominous, “I need you to write something down for me.”<br><br>Her eyes locked straight ahead, she clenched her fists again.<br><br>“For the record, as long as I’m here, <b>that</b> future will <i>never</i> come.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Beelzebibble</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">It was a kindness that Almudena turned away immediately after, or she would have seen him, frozen, as usual, his hand still lingering slightly in the air. In another moment, he would pivot out of the present and tuck himself back into his chair. He was biting his lip very hard. When he was sure that she wouldn't see - she was wiping her face with a handkerchief someone had given her - he relaxed on his lip and instantly broke into a smile. He looked down, as much to hide it beneath the collar of the hoodie as anything else. The droplet of blood he dabbed away with the edge of his sleeve, but then he turned another step away in his seat and gently closed the pages of the notebook over his palm.<br><br>He was almost ready to risk another glance at the girl sitting some ways beside him, but Nessa's story of the boy who turned to stone demanded the room's attention. Deandre's smile dropped away. The Scot was so lighthearted in the telling that some soft sure voice in his head insisted she must be joking. But he had no more than a minute to squeeze in some too-scattered notes on this strange confession before Nessa rolled off a glove and took ahold of the hand of the girl who predicted futures, Jesse Chase, and the auditorium fell apart into a machine-gun surge of images and sounds.<br><br>If Deandre hadn't been able to feel himself still seated, feet on the floor and pen in one hand, when the volley stopped, then he would've been sure Nessa had teleported them. The vision of horror she presented was like nothing in Deandre's memory. It was only when the clouds of red smoke stirred enough to reveal the throne of skulls and the grisly display beyond that he realized the setting of this apocalypse was nothing less than the ruined campus of Terminer itself - for wasn't that Miss Russell hanging there, and Miss Schwartzwald, and the man with the serpent emblem who'd managed to elect himself CANDIDATE NUMBER TWO? Only where was CANDIDATE NUMBER ONE? Deandre forced himself to search the display for the body of the bald man, only to lose sight of the pillars behind the throng of students, all <i>chained</i> at the neck, Ty and Mica and Talia and Carlos Hue and - was that - ?<br><br>The scene burned itself out of his sight. He was in the auditorium once again. Nessa was just finishing up a good scream.<br><br>He was clutching the pen so hard his knuckles had paled. Forgetting any instinct of shy avoidance, he shot an anxious look aside at the Catholic schoolgirl, who was dashing off a quick prayer. While Nessa explained, in a voice betraying more than ever her hollow struggle to stay cheerful, that this was only a possible future and not to be taken as an ironclad prediction, Almudena met his gaze. The fierce look in her eyes he could already claim to know well, but so far he'd only seen it coupled with a cheeky smile, not the grimace that had come over her face now. Something in his heart tightened. Even in distress, she was no less... oh, why hide it? She was no less beautiful than ever, but he didn't like to see this expression all the same.<br><br>Turning her face back to the stage, she muttered:<br><br>"El Literato, I need you to write something down for me. For the record, as long as I'm here, that future will <i>never</i> come."<br><br>And he murmured:<br><br>"I won't let it."<br><br>But it was another future as much as that one that he meant, or perhaps more, since, in brutal honesty, Deandre would be flattering himself to think that there was anything <i>he</i> could do to prevent that holocaust. It was a different scenario he intended never to see come about, and that was to let Nessa use her power on him. What would have happened if she'd lighted at his desk instead? What did the logical result of dialing his abilities out of proportion look like? Deandre could all too easily imagine the worst of it: losing control and unleashing his power again and again, thousands of times in a second, on everyone in the room, until all their memories were mixed together through him and redistributed at random, thought by thought. They would be a crowd of patchwork scarecrows, all stuffed with whatever scraps and rags could be swept up off the floor, with not one identity left recognizable and whole. At a stroke, the academy would be converted into an insane asylum.<br><br>He couldn't help but shrink back as Nessa returned to her seat not far from him and Almudena. Though he dutifully recorded the Mexican girl's words, he hesitated in writing further. There were obvious reasons to record the vision Nessa and Jesse had presented, not least of them the need to remind himself in the strongest terms possible that Nessa was not to touch him on any account, but on the other hand, Deandre was facing a rare thing: a memory that he would just as happily forget.<br><br><br><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler1643858').toggle();if($('#spoiler1643858').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler1643858"><i>Apparently the proper way to write Deandre is when you're sick and you keep going for these weird not-totally-conventional turns of phrase.<br><br>Also, I'm trying to stay faithful to my first interpretation of Nessa's future, which is that it's what Silumas would have done with the school if left to his own devices - hence why I had Deandre pointedly fail to notice Silumas' body hanging behind the throne.

Except for Jesse. She was frozen like the rest, but breathing hard at the same time, like two bodies overlapping one another. The boy screamed and everyone around him started to shake again. Jesse was now a single being again, and shortly after that, the hellscape disappeared.<br><br>Natural sunlight took the place of the raging inferno, but Franky still felt like his heart was about to leap from his chest. He stole a glance at Nessa. She could force a Power to unleash things no one could control. Franky remembered reading that in her student file, but at the time, he just thought that was super lame, but now? What would have happened if she had decided to touch Franky? The boy had no idea how his powers even <i>worked</i>, let alone what could possibly happen if they were pushed to maximum...<br><br>As possibilities flitted through his imagination, Franky's beating heart was replaced with a smile.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Cendra</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">“Eira and Aodhan,” Thyra paused, slight confusion appearing on her face when she didn't immediately see the twins in their seats as she expected. <br><br>Two heads of curly red hair bounced up from under the desk, blanket fort. Thyra raised an eyebrow at them as they crawled out hand in hand. <br><br>Nessa's demonstration had shaken them, but seeing the auditorium whole and everyone well again quelled their apprehension as they stepped forward. As long as they were both together, they could get through what ever challenge they faced.<br><br>“You wanted to demonstrate together correct?” <br><br>“Yes ma'am!” They replied simultaneously. Eira dusted off whatever might have been on the floor from her dark blue jeans. It seemed to be mostly crumbs from a variety of foods. Aodhan nudged his sister. <br><br>“Hey, grab the bag.” he whispered.<br><br>“Oh. Right!” Ducking her head back into the fort, she located their new, brown sack bag, grabbed it and reappeared again.  <br><br>“Got it!” She said triumphantly and straightened Harue's lent hat onto her head again.<br><br>“Nice. Let's leg it!” The twins ran up to the stage, Aodhan taking the lead with his classic grin and enthusiasm.<br><br>“Well, hello schoolmates! I'm Aodhan.” <br><br>“I'm Eira.” she spoke clearly with a cheerful smile, but with less hyper enthusiasm than her brother. Aodhan continued as Eira dug through their bag to find their demonstration materials.<br><br>“We're twins if you hadn't guessed. We're thirteen years old, from Ireland, nowhere specific. She's cool,” he pointed his thumb at his sister, then to himself, wiggling his eyebrows, “I'm hot.” Eira snorted and rolled her eyes, but couldn't help a smile. She pulled out the bubbles and ziploc bag of cents they needed. Aodhan continued like he hadn't heard her wordless comment.<br><br>“Alone, we're awesome, but together, we can do some pretty amazin' stuff.” Aodhan caught the bag of coins that Eira threw to him. <br><br>“We're all set.” she announced. <br><br>“Well, I guess it's our turn to show off then!”  he said to to his twin, though it was clearly meant to be heard by everyone. The girl smirked and nodded at him.  <br><br>After dipping it into the soapy mixture the blue bottle held, Eira blew at the bubble wand in her hand. Just as all expected, bubbles flew into the air, but these bubbles were different. As Eira blew, something like smoke left her mouth and was locked into the soapy sphere, making it look like a cloud was caught inside. Once she was satisfied with how many she had created, Eira set the bottle down and lifted her hands toward the bubbles in concentration. The trapped clouds seemed to grow thicker, but the balls still floated through the air. <br><br>“Okay, now!” she cued her brother. Aodhan emptied the bag of coins into his hand, his brow furrowed. The coin between his fingers began to heat up, but before it could burn, he launched it at one of the bubbles. The metal grew red, then yellow as it flew through the air before disappearing into a smokey orb without the expected pop. A low glow now illuminated the bubble like a mini clouded sun.  <br><br>The twins shared an excited look. This being the first time they had ever tried this particular trick.  <br><br>Once a coin was tossed into each bubble, Aodhan raised his hands in concentration as well. Sweat dripped down his flushed face, plastering a few curls to his forehead as he picture the shape he had in mind. The bubbles continued to glow and shimmer like little starts in a miniature sky.  After a minute or two, the redhead's face relaxed. <br><br>“That should do it. Your turn sis.” He said a little breathlessly as he wiped his forehead on his blue shirt sleeve. <br><br>Eira herself, was looking pale. A little blue in the lips in-fact. Slowly, all of the glowing bubbles moved to hover above each student and teacher's desk. A thin layer of frost began to form and spread across Eira's skin, making the girl shiver as she let the globes hover about a foot from each desk. The redhead let everyone study them for a few moments, but it was getting too cold. Suddenly each bubble went dark, forming into a crystal orb as Eira clenched her hands into fists. The ice globes fell from the air, shattering onto the desks with a puff of cold mist that had been trapped inside. A small choir of clinks was heard echoing through the room as shiny bits of shaped metal hit the wooden surfaces. <br><br>The shape was clearly of Celtic design. Flecks of aluminum and zinc gave the copper a swirling quality as the metal curved to resembled four cloven hooves woven together, the points angled outward.<br> <br>Eira reached toward her brother with a cold shaking hand, steam rose into the air as he held it in his own. Within seconds his flushed cheeks returned to normal and her pale ones gained back their color. <br><br>“Hope you like it! These Dara knots are our gift to you. They say it's like the roots of an oak tree and something about leadership, wisdom, destiny or some-such.  Now we can all remember our first day and keep them for luck in our first year.” with a wink and a grin, Aodhan hopped off the stage, sister agreeably in tow. <br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">"Alright, that's enough of that."<br><br>Kilik twisted the ring on his middle finger as he rose from his seat, casual as ever and thrusting his hands into his pockets. Between the the <i>scamp</i> (he had <i>not</i> been briefed on that), Almudena's blockbuster fight with whatever that thing was (and none of the staff joined in? Thyra, really?) and the random vision of the future (at least my abs looked good), it was time to lighten the mood. He might not be flashy, but he was practical when he needed to be. Sparing a glance back at Silumas, who he was pretty sure had been glaring at him about fifteen minutes ago, he settled on the middle of the podium and turned to the students.<br><br>"My name is Kilik Ginnungap," he said clearly. Sure, he wasn't as good as keeping serious tones in his voice as some of his friends, but this wasn't the time for it. Better to keep himself lighthearted. He registered, out of the corner of his eye, Emily stepping off the stage and he nodded to no one in particular. "I'm the gym teacher. I'm around if any of you guys need to talk, though. Someone-" he glanced back at Thyra "-managed to coerce me into being one of your counselors."<br><br>He ignored the awkward silence. It wasn't surprising, really. Garth had nearly destroyed the entire building, Talia had fled the stage after nearly destroying it, Carlos had had a panic attack in response to another student... There was a lot of drama to digest. Most of these kids had probably never encountered another Power before, and this wasn't exactly turning into the best display in the world. Too many issues, too much impacting each of these kids that they'd brought with them and hadn't had a chance to work out yet. Once again, he was questioning Thyra's decisions, but kept his mouth shut on the matter. For now.<br><br>"The long and short of it?" Kilik continued, glancing around at the students. On the bleachers, the dark haired girl was now sat next to the smaller boy and he was holding her hand like it was a lifeline. The boy in blue and gold, <i>Ben, you've read these files, get the names right</i>, looked the calmest of anyone on the floor. Garth's skin still hadn't gone back to the colour it had when he'd first entered the room. Even so, he pressed on.<br><br>"If Flint can do it, I can do it too," he continued, gesturing vaguely. A simple hand movement that most would pass off as a quirk of his character. The air was warm, the sun filtering in and heating the room despite the technology in the structure. "I can manipulate the cold, though I'm fairly certain the source of my powers comes from a different place to Flint's."<br><br>He stopped gesturing with every other word, a habit he'd picked up long ago and never managed to shake, and held his palms parallel with the ground. The ice, slush, some of it water at this point. He could feel it, feel how the crystals had formed and the snowflakes were constructed, every single line and groove and edge and blade. He held on to that feeling as he lifted his left hand, wriggling his fingers for a better grip on the element in front of him. With a single wave, the entire scene changed.<br><br>All of the leftover ice from Flint's demonstration suddenly surged into the air, and Kilik made circular motions with his right hand, making the ice start spinning and flowing, snowflakes instead of frozen water and swirling in the air. This, he could do. A small blizzard, contained in the air above anyone present. This was easy.<br><br><i>Yuki-onna, lend me your strength</i><br><br>He twisted his wrist and the ice started whirling, no longer snow but small chunks, like diamonds in the way they glittered under the sun. A maelstrom of ice shards flowed, and he twisted his other wrist to test what it would do. The ice flowed but the direction was different. Kilik grinned. He threw his arms wide, feeling the currents of the air, and then raised his hands up to the ceiling, the tips of his fingers gripping lightly. In one solid movement, he threw his hands down to his sides, fists clenched, and the ice above everyone scattered and formed and settled. Hanging in mid-air, rotating softly, the light casting shades of every colour against the walls.<br><br>"Evelyn, you might be able to manipulate light, but I bet we'd throw an incredible show together."<br><br>The refraction of the natural light through the crystalline shards of ice was casting a light on the ceiling. In other places too, probably, but it was the ceiling that mattered. Despite the pale colour, the lights were positioned perfectly to refact the colours and suddenly a nebula was being projected. Sure, it wasn't on a black background, but the way the purples and the oranges and the greens mixed, the harsh lines covered by each other, it was art.<br><br>Kilik gave everyone a solid minute of looking before he shrugged his shoulders and let the illusion fade.<br><br>"Enough of that."<br><br>With a sweep of his arm, all of the ice surge towards his open palm. It condensed into a solid block and, with his free hand, he ran his fingers over it. The ice chipped and fissured and crumbled within it's shape, and at that moment Emily burst back into the room, carrying a tray of bottles with vividly coloured contents.<br><br>"Snowcones!" She yelled, bouncing her way over.<br><br>"We'll be handing out snowcones to anyone who wants them," Kilik said quickly, cutting off Emily before she could get too excited. "We'll be at the edge of the stage. Tell us your favourite flavour and we can do it."<br><br>Ignoring the way Emily's face dropped, he walked over to the edge of the stage and dropped to sit there, his legs hanging over the edge and the sphere of ice shards still floating above his palm.<br><br><br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Silumas</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><i>What exactly do you hope to gain from this? </i><br><br><br><br>While he remained in the auditorium, his form splintered off and drifted a few of the Planes, becoming as two entirely different, separate, and combined forms. From the elemental planes, to the astral reaches, his consciousness and spirit drifted.<br><br><br><br><i>These are children. They are useless, they cannot control themselves emotionally, let alone their power and ability long enough to conquer a playground, let alone defeat the greatest enemy known to the entirety of Creation.<br></i><br><br><br>His inner monologue continued while students demonstrated their abilities one after another. While he continued to catalogue the activity for later use, memorizing who showed their ability to do what, nothing truly grabbing his attention again the way the other students had. The Magus had a lot on his mind and a young woman that could punch things or another that could summon things that could be punched bored him. <br><br><br><br>Kilik then took the podium and began speaking about teaching the students. Silumas laughed, or at least he really wanted to, when he spoke of being the student’s counselor. Images conjured to his mind of all the young pups running to him, mewling about their aches and woes, and the young gym teacher patting their heads, drying their tears, and telling them everything would be ok. It was truly pathetic. These students had to learn, and they had to learn fast. The only way to do that was to be pushed, and pushed hard, to excel and succeed. Evil was coming, evil greater than Silumas, and they had to be ready.<br><br><br><br>All of that dramatic, foreboding thought vanished with the speaking of a single word, “SNOW CONES!” the delightful miss Emily exclaimed as Kilik concluded his demonstration of his powers with ice and cold. <br><br><br><br>Despite his dark and scary exterior, his attempt to conquer this world not once, but twice, his most recent time spent on Earth had lead to him discovering a love of the flavored ice treat known amusingly as snowcones. Tiger’s Blood, Cherry, Grape, Watermelon, it did not really matter the flavor as he simply adored snowcones. The mysterious, robed faculty member rose from his seat and glided to Killik and Emily and all too unsubtly licked his lips in anticipation.<br><br><br><br>“I may have,” Silumas spoke slowly, never taking his eyes off the large block of ice, “underestimated your value…Coach.” No matter how he felt about the snowcones, he still had to stick to his guns regarding the man’s title.<br><br><br><br>“I would like something,” Silumas paused for a few moments, holding two fingers to his lips as he scanned the ice thinking quickly, in fact excitedly, as evidenced by his face, “fruity...I think you would say tropical.”</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Shoni</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Most of the demonstrations seemed to grind by after Flint had reentered the gymnasium. There were a few interesting abilities but boredom had still begun to set in. Slowly closing his eyes he drew in a deep breath and let the noises of the student around him fill his mind. Almudena’s voice was easily recognized among the crowd; after all it was considerably louder. Suddenly the atmosphere of the room began to change. Some girl who had been rambling on the stage walked over to another student and lightly touched her hand. Flint’s eyes snapped open, observing the scene below. He could feel his body trying to fight the panic that seemed to rise from his chest, slowly stretching its chilling fingers towards his limbs. The body of each student present dangled from a chain nearby. They seemed so lifelike. As suddenly as the nightmare had appeared it faded away and the gym’s sturdy walls surrounded them once again. Looking down Flint noticed that he was tightly clenching a dagger.  Releasing his death grip on the knife it dropped to the floor, melting into a puddle. He had seen things like that before but this one felt different, like it could be avoided.<br><br>As the room settled down the two small twins emerged from there fort and scurried to the front of the room. They seemed giddy while they filled the room with bubbles. Each soapy sphere housed a tiny cloud that slowly grew to fill its home. The two red heads seemed to struggle finishing their trick. The bubbles glowed brightly before floating to each student. Reaching forward, Flint tried to catch one that floated near his face. The thin film popped under his soft touch and the Dara knot fell into his open palm.<br>After the twins returned to their fort a teacher stood up and began playing with a ring before speaking to the students. During the speech Flint stood up and walked over to the twin’s fort, sitting down on the floor just outside the entrance. The use of his name drew his attention to the stage as the teacher began collecting the remaining ice in the room into a swirling cloud. Flint could feel each tiny particle flying through the air as they collided forming larger crystal structures. A thin stream of ice separated itself from the cloud, flowing toward his open palm. The shards flowed around his fingers forming talons as he absentmindedly watched the cloud above. It spread out and began to refract the light over the ceiling in blurred rippling waves. Rushing back to the teacher, the icy shards formed a block that he broke into tiny flakes.<br><br>“Snowcones!”<br><br>As soon as Emily bounced back into the room Flint was on his feet and motioning for the twins to come along. He quickly made his way across the gym slipping into line behind Silumas.<br><br>“Excuse me Professor Charles you’re holding up the line.”<br></div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">Yoshimitsu</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message"><div class="spoiler_header"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#spoiler4014092').toggle();if($('#spoiler4014092').is(':visible'))$(this).text('SPOILER: Click to hide');else $(this).text('SPOILER: Click to show');">SPOILER: Click to show</a></div><div class="spoiler" id="spoiler4014092">Literally threw this together in 10 minutes, sorry 'bout it</div><br><br>Kilik raised an eyebrow as Silumas rose from his chair. The robes flowed around him and anyone else might have found it impressive, the way he managed to make it look like he had a massive fan aimed at him at all times. Not so much for Kilik. He'd seen much more impressive things. In fact, he was more concerned that the (questionable choice, Thyra) teacher seemed to be making a beeline for the ice block. Smash it, or smash it into Kiliks face, or what? Silumas was a harsh guy. It was hard to judge.<br><br>And then it was hard to keep his face straight.<br><br>Kilik wanted to burst out laughing, was nearly going to if he hadn't worried about the aftermath that could follow. This dude, this scary-as-fuck and deliberately intimidating dude, had a soft spot for sugary treats. Alright, Kilik could work with that. Ignoring the term 'coach' again, he let his grin show, wide and bright.<br><br>"Something tropical? No problem," he said, flicking his wrist and sending the ice above their heads.<br><br>He pulled one of the paper cones from Emily's tray with one hand, the other making circles in the air and a sphere of ice shards landed on the paper. He tossed the cone into the air and grabbed a bottle, a deep orange, and squeezed, squirting the liquid directly into the spiralling ice cone. Before it hit its peak, he grabbed the pale yellow bottle and took a second to aim, squeezing the bottle just the same but hitting the ice in its untouched surface. As it made its descent, he grabbed the bottle with the rich, deep red liquid and let the cone fall on the nozzle. A quick shot and he pulled the snow cone from the nozzle, offering it to Silumas.<br><br>"Mango, pineapple and cherry flavour, enjoy," he said with a grin on his face.</div></div><h2><center style="font-family: serif;">SHADOWMASTER89</center></h2><div style="width:70%; margin: 0 auto; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><div class="message">Talia had returned to her seat once Nessa had returned to the safe distance she previously inhabited before her hellish demonstration.  She occasionally glanced in the girl's direction despite the fact that her vibratory senses would easily alert her to any movement.  Something about seeing that the girl was a safe distance away still gave her a reassuring feeling.  She had more interest in the twin's demonstration than she'd had in most of the others.  Throughout the course of the demonstration she noticed that the molecular vibrations of the girl became more and more sluggish and those of the boy became more and more hyperactive, in fact, by the end the girl visibly appeared as if she was slowly freezing to death and the boy was sweating and would likely have experienced heat stroke if the two of them had not taken each other's hand when they did.  This confirmed what her senses had told her early on, that the two of them essentially regulated one another via touch.<br><br>As the first of the staff demonstrations began, Talia twirled the Dara knot that had landed on her desk from the twin's demonstration, her mind wandering as she found Kilik's ice demo less interesting than Flint's, at least until the light refraction display on the ceiling.  She noticed that it looked exactly like a nebula.  While her interests were primarily science related, that had mostly encompassed biology and physics.  She had studied space some, but it had never really been the focus of her interests.  Biology and physics had always interested her more because of how they applied, <i>somehow</i>, to her abilities.<br><br>"Snowcones!"  Emily suddenly screamed.<br><br>Talia blinked, her entire train of thought vanishing as she looked to the stage.  The ice from the demo was all now in the shape of a block and Emily had brought a tray of bottles filled with colorful liquids.  Talia could scarcely recall the last time she'd had a snowcone, but she knew from the few happy childhood memories she possessed that she had liked them at some point in her past.  As soon as Flint made a beeline for the stage she followed and managed to jump in line behind him, still keeping an eye on Nessa, of course.  When she finally reached the head of the line her face finally achieved a smile for once as she quickly thought of her two favorite fruit flavors.<br><br>"Do you have kiwi and grape?"</div></div></body>
